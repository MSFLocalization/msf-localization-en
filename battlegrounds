ID_BATTLEGROUNDS_RULES_BODY,"1) Set up your defenses (5-character squad required).\n\n2) Challenge opponents based on their rank. If you win, you will swap ranks with them. If you lose, your rank will remain unchanged.\n\n3) After each battle, you must wait a set period of time before you can enter the next battle. If you do not wish to wait, you can bypass the wait period by spending POWER CORES.\n\n4) You will receive a payout in your Inbox every 24 hours based on your reward tier. Additionally, the number of attacks allowed daily will reset.\n\n5) Your Arena is determined by your timezone and the date when you join. Each Arena has a maximum number of players allowed, and when it reaches full capacity, a new one is created.\n\n6) While you are participating in an active battle, you can still be attacked by other players."
