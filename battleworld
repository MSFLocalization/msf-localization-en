ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_HEADER,Rules of Battleworld
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_01,Assemble Your Alliance
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_01,"You and your alliance have landed on Battleworld, a patchwork planet forged by an unknown entity. Battleworld is comprised of many territories, each with a Boss to rule it. You and your alliance must come together to conquer Battleworld territories and neutralize this dangerous planet."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_02,Conquer Each Territory
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_02,"Your alliance must work together to progress through the active territory by defeating each of its 6 zones. Alliances can only defeat one zone per day, and with sieges lasting 6 total days, only the strongest alliances will reach the final zone."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_03,Advance through Zones
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_03,"Earn enough Victory Points (VP) as an alliance to advance to the next zone before the end of the day. Fail to earn enough VP before the day ends and your alliance will need to repeat the zone, but will retain any VP previously earned in that zone. VP can be earned by completing a variety of missions in the current zone."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_04,Earn VP by Defeating Waves
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_04,"Each zone has individual missions that you can complete in any order to earn VP for your alliance. VP is granted for each mission wave cleared. You can attempt a mission multiple times but missions reset between attempts and you will only be awarded for newly cleared waves. Characters on Battleworld can only be used once per day, so you will need to plan your attacks strategically."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_05,Earn Bonus VP from Spec Ops
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_05,Most zones have Special Operations missions that you can add characters to for additional alliance VP. Each Spec Ops mission will need multiple alliance members to add their characters in order to fully complete the mission and earn the bonus VP. Complete more Spec Ops missions to earn more VP.
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_06,Fight for T3 Iso-8
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_06,The Elite Mission in each zone has more narrow trait requirements but grants additional alliance rewards based on the total number of alliance waves cleared. Alliance rewards are sent at the end of each active day and contain valuable upgrades like T3 Iso-8.
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_07,Battle the Boss
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_07,"If your alliance can make it to the final zone in the siege, you'll have a chance to challenge the Boss in a final battle. The siege Boss is incredibly powerful in its home territory and you'll need your entire alliance to take it down. Only the strongest alliances will be able to defeat the Boss, but those who do will earn a large VP boost each time the Boss is defeated."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_08,VP Breakdown
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_08,The amount of VP rewarded increases in later zones and on higher siege difficulties. Higher difficulties also rewards better zone and siege rewards. Keep pushing your alliance to maximize your rewards!
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_08B,"At the end of every siege, alliance members are rewarded for the total alliance VP earned throughout that week."
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_SUBHEADER_09,Season Rewards
ID_BATTLEWORLD_RULES_BODY_09,Battleworld Season Leaderboards pay out every four weeks. Leaderboard ranking is based on total alliance VP earned throughout the season (four total sieges). Check back often for updates to Battleworld Season rewards!
