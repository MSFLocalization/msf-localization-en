ID_ME_BO_ORANGEGEAR_MAKEGOOD_202009,"Commander,\n\nOver the weekend, there was an issue with the Orange Catalyst Orb where some players received 3,000 orbs from the Valuable Lessons Calendar. The Dev team resolved the mistake with the orb quickly and is currently working on next steps to make a correction to the players' accounts who may have opened any of those incorrectly granted orbs, and made use of the resources. This correction will not impact players who did not erroneously receive these orbs. As a part of the correction, we will be taking the game down for a period of time later in the week.\n\nWe understand reverting gear progress is extremely frustrating and it's not something we take lightly, but the severity of our mistake is such that we can't let affected players keep their progress, nor can we make the incorrect amounts available to everyone. After the correction goes into effect, we'll be sending out two forms of compensation:\n\n- To the players directly affected by the correction: you'll receive a compensation package for the resources and time invested, as well as the inconvenience we've caused.\n\n- To all other players: a compensation package to alleviate the competitive advantage that other players gained between the time the bug went live and the corrections and the general inconvenience that this issue has caused you as well.\n\nWe apologize for our mistake, and thank you for your patience."

ID_ME_DE_SSOFFERISSUE_ANNOUNCE,Terms of Service & Policy
ID_ME_BO_SSOFFERISSUE_ANNOUNCE,"We recently identified an issue that allowed players to purchase a Silver Surfer offer more than the allowed limit. This has been corrected and all five accounts had the excess shards of Silver Surfer removed, mitigating any advantage.\n\nTo ensure everyone has an equal chance for Silver Surfer character shards, we have decided to release the same offer ($20 for 50 Silver Surfer shards - limit two) for a second round to all players in the near future. We will be closely monitoring the number of purchases carefully, and any account found to acquire it more than twice will be at risk of an indefinite ban. Intentionally leveraging exploits is against our Terms of Service, and while we know loopholes like this are our responsibility to oversee, we won't hesitate taking punitive action against players who exploit them while we work to close them.\n\nOur team is currently diagnosing the cause of the issue and is planning a course of action on how to prevent it from happening again in the future. Thank you for your patience.\n\n-- MARVEL Strike Force Dev Team"

ID_ME_BO_CORRECTION,"You may have recently received an Inbox message noting that your account is being monitored for exploits or cheating. We did not intend to send this message to you, or anyone else.\n\nWe would like to explain what happened. First, there was an error on our end that unintentionally granted your account points towards the Rollin' Rebel event. Second, to correct for this, your account, along with a few others, were removed from the event Leaderboard to recalculate scores and not disrupt the Rank Rewards - you'll have your rewards sent separately. This action triggered an automated message, which is the one you saw. This was an old message that was meant for players who had been caught cheating.\n\nAgain, this was our error, not yours, and we apologize for any suggestion that you were exploiting or cheating. It was never meant for you. We are addressing the issue to ensure that it doesn't happen again."
