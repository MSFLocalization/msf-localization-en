ID_MIS_PD_SL_CI_HINT_01,<color=#fff568>Shattered Dimension</color> Hints\n- If you're struggling with a difficult battle increasing the power of your characters can be very helpful.

ID_MIS_PD_SL_CI_HINT_05,<color=#fff568>Shattered Dimension</color> Hints\n- S.T.R.I.K.E. is monitoring a dramatic surge in the number of multiversal events. It may soon be necessary to explore many of these mysterious Pocket Dimensions to see what secrets they hold.
ID_MIS_PD_SL_CI_HINT_06,"<color=#fff568>Shattered Dimension</color> Hints\n- The Cabal synergizes with Villains, while the Illuminati work best with Heroes.\n- The first allies you will have in this mission are villains, and if they fall heroes will come to your aid."
