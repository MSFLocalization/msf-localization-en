ID_GLOSSARY_NAME,GLOSSARY
ID_GLOSSARY_DESC,Hey there!  This is the glossary for how various stats and effects work in Marvel Strike Force.
ID_GLOSSARY_FX,Positive and Negative Effects
ID_GLOSSARY_FX_DESC,"Positive and Negative Effects are applied to characters in combat.\n\nIn general, abilities apply Positive Effects to your team and Negative Effects to the opposing team."
ID_GLOSSARY_POSITIVE_FX,Positive Effects
ID_GLOSSARY_POSITIVE_FX_DESC,Positive Effects are usually beneficial to the character they are applied to.  They appear over characters' heads in combat as icons on a green disc.\n\nA handful of abilities apply certain positive effects (such as <color=#fff568>Taunt</color>) to your opponents.
ID_GLOSSARY_OFFENSE_UP_DESC,"<color=#fff568>Offense Up</color> increases a character's effective Damage and Focus stats by 50%.\n\nThis is multiplicative with <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color> or <color=#fff568>Defense Down</color>, so your effective damage against an opponent with <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color> would be 50% of 150%, or 75% of normal."
ID_GLOSSARY_DEFENSE_UP_DESC,"<color=#fff568>Defense Up</color> increases a character's effective Resistance stat by 50%, and reduces incoming damage by 50%.\n\nThis effect is multiplicative with <color=#fff568>Offense Up</color> or <color=#fff568>Offense Down</color>. If a character has Armor, that damage reduction is applied after that of <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_SPEED_UP_DESC,<color=#fff568>Speed Up</color> increases a character's effective Speed by 50%.
ID_GLOSSARY_TAUNT_DESC,"If you have at least one opponent with the <color=#fff568>Taunt</color> effect, you must target an opponent with <color=#fff568>Taunt</color>.  Some abilities may bypass this restriction.\n\nA character with <color=#fff568>Taunt</color> who gains <color=#fff568>Stealth</color> loses <color=#fff568>Taunt</color>, and vice-versa."
ID_GLOSSARY_STEALTH_DESC,"You cannot target an opponent who has the <color=#fff568>Stealth</color> effect unless all opponents have <color=#fff568>Stealth</color>.\n\nSome chains and most multi-target attacks will hit characters even if they have <color=#fff568>Stealth</color>.\n\nA character with <color=#fff568>Stealth</color> who gains <color=#fff568>Taunt</color> loses <color=#fff568>Stealth</color>, and vice-versa."
ID_GLOSSARY_HOT_DESC,"At the start of their turn, a character with <color=#fff568>Regeneration</color> heals for 10% of the Max Health of the character who applied <color=#fff568>Regeneration</color> to them."
ID_GLOSSARY_COUNTER_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Counterattack</color> will attack the next character who hits them with an attack they can respond to.\n\nSome attacks cannot be countered. Being hit with such an attack doesn't remove <color=#fff568>Counterattack</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_EVADE_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Evade</color> will dodge the next attack directed against them which they can dodge.\n\nSome attacks cannot be dodged. Failing to dodge such attacks usually doesn't remove <color=#fff568>Evade</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_DEATHPROOF_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Deathproof</color> will stay at 1 health and lose <color=#fff568>Deathproof</color> instead of being defeated the next time they take damage.\n\nAbilities which steal health rather than dealing damage bypass <color=#fff568>Deathproof</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_ASSISTNOW_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Assist Now</color> will assist the current character if they attack.  <color=#fff568>Assist Now</color> goes away at the end of the turn if it isn't triggered.\n\nSome non-attack abilities also trigger <color=#fff568>Assist Now</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_DEFLECT_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Deflect</color> will block the next attack directed against them which they can block.\n\nSome attacks cannot be blocked. Failing to block such attacks still removes <color=#fff568>Deflect</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_IMMUNITY_DESC,"A character with <color=#fff568>Immunity</color> cannot have negative effects applied to them.\n\nThey can still fail to resist other effects, including those which would remove <color=#fff568>Immunity</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_CHARGED_DESC,"A character with <color=#fff568>Charged</color> will gain benefits specified in their abilities.\n\n<color=#fff568>Charged</color> persists between combats in game modes where characters have persistent health, such as Raids, War, and Dark Dimension."
ID_GLOSSARY_RANDOM_POS_FX,Random Positive Effect
ID_GLOSSARY_RANDOM_POS_FX_DESC,"If an ability says it applies a random positive effect, it has an equal chance of applying <color=#fff568>Offense Up</color>, <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color>, or <color=#fff568>Speed Up</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_NEGATIVE_FX,Negative Effects
ID_GLOSSARY_NEGATIVE_FX_DESC,Negative Effects are harmful to the character they are applied to.  They appear over characters' heads in combat as icons on a red disc.\n\nA handful of abilities apply negative effects to the acting character or to their allies.
ID_GLOSSARY_OFFENSE_DOWN_DESC,"<color=#fff568>Offense Down</color> decreases a character's effective Damage and Focus stats by 50%.\n\nThis is multiplicative with <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color> or <color=#fff568>Defense Down</color>, so your effective damage against an opponent with <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color> would be 50% of 50%, or 25% of normal."
ID_GLOSSARY_DEFENSE_DOWN_DESC,"<color=#fff568>Defense Down</color> decreases a character's effective Resistance stat by 50%, and increases incoming damage by 50%.\n\nThis effect is multiplicative with <color=#fff568>Offense Up</color> or <color=#fff568>Offense Down</color>. If a character has Armor, that damage reduction is applied after the damage increase from <color=#fff568>Defense Down</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_SPEED_DOWN_DESC,<color=#fff568>Slow</color> decreases a character's effective Speed by 50%.
ID_GLOSSARY_STUN_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Stun</color> doesn't get to act on their next turn.
ID_GLOSSARY_ACCURACYDOWN_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Blind</color> loses 100% Accuracy.\n\nCharacters who have a base Accuracy which is greater than 100% still have a chance to hit their targets.
ID_GLOSSARY_HEALBLOCK_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Heal Block</color> cannot regain health by healing.\n\nThey may still steal health or have it transferred to them.
ID_GLOSSARY_ABILITYBLOCK_DESC,A character with <color=#fff568>Ability Block</color> can only use their Basic attack on their turn.
ID_GLOSSARY_DOT_DESC,"At the start of their turn, a character with <color=#fff568>Bleed</color> takes damage. This damage bypasses Barrier.\n\nThe amount of damage dealt is based on the damage of the character and the level of the ability that applied <color=#fff568>Bleed</color>, as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 45% damage\nLevel2: 65% damage\nLevel 3: 80% damage\nLevel 4: 100% damage\nLevel 5: 115% damage\nLevel 6: 135% damage\nLevel 7: 150% damage"
ID_GLOSSARY_DISRUPTED_DESC,"A character with <color=#fff568>Disrupted</color> cannot have positive effects applied to them.\n\nThey can still benefit from healing and other combat effects, including those which would remove <color=#fff568>Disrupted</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_RANDOM_NEG_FX,Random Negative Effect
ID_GLOSSARY_RANDOM_NEG_FX_DESC,"If an ability says it applies a random negative effect, it has an equal chance of applying <color=#fff568>Offense Down</color>, <color=#fff568>Defense Down</color>, or <color=#fff568>Slow</color>."
ID_GLOSSARY_STATS,Character Attributes
ID_GLOSSARY_STATS_DESC,A character's performance in combat is determined by their Attribute values.\n\nCharacter attributes generally fall into one of two categories:\n\n- <color=#fff568>Core Attributes</color> (which scale with progression)\n- <color=#fff568>Secondary Attributes</color> (which rarely change).
ID_GLOSSARY_CORE_STATS,Core Attributes
ID_GLOSSARY_CORE_STATS_DESC,"Core Attributes scale with character Level, Gear, Gear Tier, Star Rank, Red Stars, Stark Tech, and Iso 8.\n\nThese values are Core Attributes:\n\n-Damage\n-Health\n-Armor\n-Focus\n-Resistance"
ID_GLOSSARY_HEALTH_DESC,A character's <color=#fff568>Health</color> determines how much damage a character can take before they are defeated.\n\nHealing abilities usually scale off a character's <color=#fff568>Health</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_DAMAGE_DESC,"A character's <color=#fff568>Damage</color> is the base value used by Abilities when calculating how much damage they will deal.\n\nAbilities multiply a character's base <color=#fff568>Damage</color> value, and may modify how it is applied (such as making it <color=#fff568>Piercing</color>)."
ID_GLOSSARY_ARMOR_DESC,"A character's <color=#fff568>Armor</color> reduces incoming damage before it's applied to the character's health.\n\n<color=#fff568>Piercing</color> damage ignores <color=#fff568>Armor</color>, and temporarily reduces its effectiveness against non-<color=#fff568>Piercing</color> damage which is part of the same attack."
ID_GLOSSARY_FOCUS_DESC,"A character's <color=#fff568>Focus</color> controls whether effects get applied to opposing characters.\n\nThe higher a character's <color=#fff568>Focus</color>, the more likely they are to apply Negative Effects and clear Positive Effects from opponents."
ID_GLOSSARY_RESISTANCE_DESC,"A character's <color=#fff568>Resistance</color> controls whether opponents can apply Negative Effects to or clear Positive Effects off that character.\n\nThe higher a character's <color=#fff568>Resistance</color>, the more likely they are to resist opponents applying Negative Effects and clearing Positive Effects.\n\nIf a character would apply a negative effect to themselves or to an ally, that Negative Effect cannot be resisted."
ID_GLOSSARY_SECONDARY_STATS,Secondary Attributes
ID_GLOSSARY_SECONDARY_STATS_DESC,"Secondary Attributes generally don't change except by increasing abilities which reference them.\n\nCertain Secondary Attributes, like <color=#fff568>Dodge Chance</color>, <color=#fff568>Block Chance</color>, <color=#fff568>Accuracy</color>, and <color=#fff568>Block Amount</color>, have initial values which vary between characters."
ID_GLOSSARY_CRIT_DAMAGE_DESC,The value an attack's damage is multiplied by when that attack is a <color=#fff568>Critical Hit</color>.
ID_GLOSSARY_CRIT_CHANCE_DESC,"The percentage chance a given attack will be a <color=#fff568>Critical Hit</color>.\n\nIf an action hits multiple opponents, or a single opponent multiple times (or both), each discrete application of damage has a chance of being a <color=#fff568>Critical Hit</color>.\n\nSome abilities specify that they cannot inflict <color=#fff568>Critical Hit</color>s."
ID_GLOSSARY_SPEED_DESC,"The amount a character's Speed Bar charges per time unit that passes in combat. A <color=#fff568>Speed</color> value of 100 is considered average.\n\nA character can take an action once their Speed Bar reaches or exceeds 1000. If multiple characters can act, the character with the highest Speed Bar value acts first.\n\nTaking your turn reduces your Speed Bar by 1000."
ID_GLOSSARY_DODGE_CHANCE_DESC,The chance that a character will <color=#fff568>Dodge</color> an incoming attack. Dodging an attack prevents all damage and other effects linked to that attack.\n\nSome actions contain multiple attacks which must be dodged individually.\n\nSome attacks cannot be dodged. <color=#fff568>Unavoidable</color> attacks cannot miss or be dodged.
