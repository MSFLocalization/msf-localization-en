ID_RAIDS_DIFFICULTY_POPUP_SUBHEADER2,
ID_RAIDS_DIFFICULTY_POPUP_BODY,"<color=#86e619>1)</color> Some raids have additional difficulties you can unlock by reaching a specified completion threshold. (60% or 100% - varies by raid.)\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Once a new difficulty is unlocked, you can select it when launching the raid.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Each new difficulty increases enemy stats.  These stat bonuses are applied to the Raid's normal difficulty, not the previous difficulty. Higher difficulties may also include rule changes, such as limiting how many heals a player can use between raid nodes.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> Each difficulty grants bonus rewards when you clear raid nodes and reach completion thresholds.  (All participating players receive the Reward Tier bonus once for reaching 30% completion, twice for reaching 60% completion, and three times for reaching 100% completion.)\n\n<color=#86e619>5)</color> The first time you reach the completion threshold for each raid difficulty, you will earn additional rewards and your alliance will unlock the next difficulty!  (A player can only earn these first time rewards once, even if they switch Alliances.)\n\n<color=#86e619>6)</color> The # of Raid Season points earned from clearing raid nodes may be updated between raid seasons."
