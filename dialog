ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_MEDIC_0,Looks like you need some medical attention. I'm calling in backup.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_START_0,Kingpin is working with alien forces to abduct heroes and transport them in stasis orbs. You need to get to his warehouse before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_ELEKTRA_0,Kingpin said you might come looking for him. Your search ends here.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_LUKE_0,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_1_NICKFURY_0,Now take out these mercs and get to Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_0,So when do we get to find out what S.T.R.I.K.E. is about and what's going on here?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_1,"That's on a ""need to know"" basis, Spider-Man. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_2,All you currently need to know is that you need to stop Kingpin and recover those orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_INTRO_3,"Geez. If I didn't ""need to know,"" I wouldn't have asked."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_2_START_0,The Kingpin ordered me to take you in. You're next on his list.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_0,"So Kingpin is trapping heroes in interdimensional orbs for some mysterious alien? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_1,And Fury recruited us to stop him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_2,That's all we know?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_INTRO_3,Have you MET Nick Fury? I'm surprised he told us THAT much.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_START_0,This is where Kingpin is keeping those interdimensional orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_START_1,How did Fisk get his hands on alien tech like this?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_KINGPIN_0,Fools. I'm a part of something much bigger now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_KINGPIN_1,Didn't know you could get any bigger...
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_0,Good job stopping Kingpin. It will take us months to get enough power cores to open all these orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_1,And there are heroes trapped in ALL of these orbs?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_2,We'll have to open them to know for sure.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_3,"I let one of the trucks escape so we can follow it to the source. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_3_END_4,That's your next objective.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_0,We traced the truck back to a covert Hydra base in the mountains.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_1,HYDRA? The scary world domination guys? What have they got to do with this?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_2,"That's what we need to find out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_4_INTRO_3,Get in there and find out what Hydra is doing with those orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_0,Kingpin and Hydra are abducting heroes and trapping them in orbs.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_1,But what is Hydra doing with the orbs once they're here?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_INTRO_2,I get the feeling we're about to find out.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_CROSSBONES_0,"Great. More heroes for the boss. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_5_CROSSBONES_1,"Didn't even have to go out and abduct you guys. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_INTRO_0,All the orbs are being moved to the center of the base.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_INTRO_1,That must be where we'll find our answers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_WINTERSOLDIER_0,You're too late. This portal is already fully active.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_WINTERSOLDIER_1,Wait. Did he say portal?
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_1_0,1 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_2_0,2 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_3_0,3 of 4 stages activated.
ID_DIALOG_DEVICE_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,"The device has been activated. Mission failed. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_6_END_0,Interdimensional orbs. Genetically engineered soldiers. I picked a bad day to ditch school and join S.T.R.I.K.E.!
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_0,Colonel Fury says you need some firepower.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_1,"So he called you? Things are worse than I thought. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_2,I'm here to do whatever it takes to complete the mission.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_INTRO_3,"That's what I'm afraid of. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_START_0,You will not stop Hydra and its new allies from converting this world.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_7_END_0,Hydra is sending the orbs through an interdimensional portal. We need to shut it down.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_0,Those Hydra Operators are sending the orbs through that interdimensional portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_1,I got this. The rest of you move out of the way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_2,"Punisher, we need to work as a team if we're going to get this done."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_3,"Fine, Cage. How do you want to do this?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_4,We take down the <color=#fff568>OPERATORS</color> first to stop them from sending the orbs through.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_5,"You can take the lead on this one, Cage. But if things go sideways..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_INTRO_6,I'm doing it my way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_0,The Hydra Operators are sending the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_1,We need to stop them before they send all the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_2,"THIS MISSION HAS A SPECIAL OBJECTIVE. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_START_3,TAKE OUT THE HYDRA <color=#fff568>OPERATORS</color> BEFORE THEY GET TO STAGE 4.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_0,The Hydra Operators have sent the first orb through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_0,They've sent half the orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_0,They've sent another orb through the portal!
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,We didn't take out the OPERATORS in time. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_0,"We stopped Hydra from sending those orbs through the portal. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_1,"But I get the feeling this fight is far from over. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_8_END_2,"Guys, my Spidey-Sense is going off the charts. Something BIG is heading this way. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_0,What now?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_1,Now we take down these weird blue guys guarding this portal and destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_INTRO_2,You make it sound so easy.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_START_0,What's the deal with these blue aliens guarding the portal?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_START_1,Don't care. As long as they go down when I shoot them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_HULK_0,Hulk SMASH!
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_HULK_1,"Uh, guys? What's the Hulk doing on the wrong side of the ""good guy"" line?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_0,"What was up with that weaker, but equally scary, Hulk attacking us?!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_1,That was NOT the Hulk from our dimension. He was a corrupted version from an alternate dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_2,Who in the what now?
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_3,Get back to base. It's time I told you the true purpose of S.T.R.I.K.E. and what we're dealing with.
ID_DIALOG_HER_1_9_END_4,"I guess that means we finally ""need to know."""
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_0,I created S.T.R.I.K.E. to deal with interdimensional threats...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_1,The kind of stuff even S.H.I.E.L.D. or the Avengers are not equipped to deal with.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_2,So I'm assuming this qualifies?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_3,"Definitely. Interdimensional portals are opening up all over the world. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_4,Corrupted versions of Earth's most powerful and dangerous people are pouring out through them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_INTRO_5,And we're the only ones who can stop them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_0,Can't we all just get along?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_1,These are NOT heroes from our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_START_2,They are corrupted versions from alternate dimensions. Take them down.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_1_MID_0,Soon you will all bow to the new king.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_0,I'm in communication with Nick Furys from other dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_1,Many warned me about this interdimensional threat before losing contact.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_2,I had hoped they would never find our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_3,What's so special about our dimension?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_4,"Most dimensions only connect to one or two others. But ours is unique. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_5,"It's a Nexus between dimensions... a gateway to countless other Earths. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_INTRO_6,"If this dimension falls, the invaders will have access to thousands of other dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_0,"Aww, Iron Man? They corrupted you, too?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_1,"Not corrupted, Parker. Liberated."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_2,We have all been united for one singular purpose. You're next.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_3,"Gonna have to pass on that offer, Mr. Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_START_4,"Kinda enjoying the whole ""free will"" thing."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_0,There's more of you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_1,"We got a whole army of Iron Mans from other dimensions. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_2_MORE_2,You really ARE full of yourself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_0,A group of corrupted Rocket Raccoons is running rampant through the city.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_1,Hold up. Are you saying there are multiple versions of those jet pack rats?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_2,Yes. They've conquered hundreds of dimensions before coming here.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_3,"And each one has the flying, talking squirrel in it?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_INTRO_4,Yes. They're also weapons experts. Exercise caution.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_START_0,Hey! Who let the trash pandas out of their cages?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_START_1,What did you call us?!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_3_END_0,So do we call animal control or what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_0,"The Commander is sending us to infiltrate this base and kidnap Ronan, one of the Kree generals leading the invasion."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_1,What's the point in kidnapping one of these guys?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_2,We need to know what their plan is. Ronan has the intel we need.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_3,I bet I can make him talk.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_4_INTRO_4,"That's not how S.T.R.I.K.E. operates, Punisher. We hold ourselves to a higher standard. "
ID_DIALOG_TIMER_LOSE_0,Fall back. We ran out of time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_0,"The big blue alien with the hammer is Ronan, the one we need to take down and bring back to base."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_1,"He looks pretty tough. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_2,"If this mission was easy, Fury wouldn't have sent S.T.R.I.K.E., right?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_INTRO_3,"Fair enough. Let's do this. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_0,"If you think you can defeat Ronan the Accuser, you are sorely mistaken."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_1,We don't want to defeat you...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_2,"We just want to kidnap and interrogate you. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_3,"THIS MISSION HAS A <color=#fff568>SPECIAL OBJECTIVE</color>. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_START_4,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>RONAN</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_0,"This is a TIMED mission. Take out RONAN before time runs out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_REMINDER_0,We only need to take down Ronan. But we have to hurry.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_TIMER_LOSE_0,We took too much time. We need to fall back.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_5_END_0,We've got Ronan. Let's get out of here before reinforcements arrive.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_INTRO_0,We've got to get this Ronan guy back to base before he wakes up.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_INTRO_1,I've called for an extraction pod. We just need to hold out until it arrives.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_OPDEAD_0,The S.H.I.E.L.D. OPERATOR is down. She was our ride out of here!
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_1_0,The extraction pod has been called in.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_1_1,1 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_2_0,The pod is zeroing in on our coordinates.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_2_1,2 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_DONE_0,Prepare for extraction.
ID_DIALOG_EXTRACTION_POD_DONE_1,3 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_0,You're going to tell us everything we want to know about this invasion plan.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_1,You will find out nothing from me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_2,"Widow, prep the psychics. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_3,"Yes, sir."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_6_END_4,"We'll find out what Ronan knows, one way or another."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_0,"Colonel, we're receiving a broadcast on a restricted channel."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_1,"It's also being sent to every major intelligence agency and criminal organization in the world. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_2,On screen.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_3,"Leaders of this dimension. I am Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_4,"I have come to accept your unconditional surrender. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_5,"In the dimension I come from, you have all already joined my cause."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_6,"And on every Earth I conquer, it plays out the same way."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_7,"Some of you will join me. Others will resist. But eventually... "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_8,ALL WILL SUBMIT TO MY WILL.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_9,And to the leaders of S.T.R.I.K.E. who have already begun to meddle in my plans. Know this...
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_10,You will be the first to fall.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_11,"Sir, detecting multiple enemies closing in on the Helicarrier!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_INTRO_12,Battle stations!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_0,"Never thought I'd say this, but..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_1,We've come to get our Ronan back.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_7_START_2,So they extracted your free will but left your sense of humor intact?
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_0,Another wave of Ultimus's forces just breached the Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_1,"They really want this Ronan guy back. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_INTRO_2,Which means we can't let them have him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_8_REDSKULL_0,Hail Hydra! For Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_0,"Sir, a squad of Ultimus's forces has infiltrated the Helicarrier."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_1,"Get them off this ship. Once we're clear, I'll engage the cloaking device."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_INTRO_2,"Yes, sir."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_START_0,"Release Ronan now, and Ultimus might spare you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_MID_0,Now you face the full power of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_0,The Helicarrier is secure. And the psychics were able to break through Ronan's mind.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_1,Good. Cloaking engaged. That should buy us some time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_2_9_END_2,"Now let's see what Ronan's hiding. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_0,Tapping into Ronan's mind revealed a lot about Ultimus's invasion plan.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_1,"For starters, it appears he uses the last dimension he conquers as a staging area for his next assault."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_2,So finding a way into that dimension could be the key to stopping the invasion?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_3,"Which means we need to build our own interdimensional portal. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_4,And you want me to steal the components from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_5,I'm on it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_INTRO_6,What's the point of keeping psychics around when she reads minds like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_START_0,Expect the base to be heavily guarded by corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_1_START_1,Like these.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INTRO_0,You'll need to cover me while I extract the schematics we need to build the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INTRO_1,You got it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_START_0,Cover me while I access the database for the schematics.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_1_0,The schematics are being accessed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_2_0,Halfway through uploading the schematics.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_3_0,Schematics almost uploaded.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_DONE_0,Upload complete. Preparing for evacuation.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_2_FAIL_0,They've taken out Black Widow. Abort...
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_0,"Can't let you leave with those schematics, Natasha."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_1,"Cap, isn't there still a small piece of you that knows you're on the wrong side?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_2,"There are no sides here, Black Widow. Just those loyal to Ultimus..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_INTRO_3,... and those who will be.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_START_0,Clear the area so the extraction pod can land.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_3_END_0,Transport is en route. Evacuation commencing.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_0,We've analyzed the schematics to build our own portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_1,"Unfortunately, we're going to need a hyper-advanced artificial intelligence processor to operate it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_2,Where are we going to get something like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_3,We're going to steal it. From an Ultron factory.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_4,"The robot? That took on ALL of the Avengers at once? And almost won? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_5,We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_INTRO_6,"Yeah. 'Cause that's what happens ALL the time. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_4_START_0,We'll need to get past these Ultron sentries to get into the base.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_INTRO_0,The Ultron mainframe should be up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_INTRO_1,"Good. The sooner we get out of this killer robot factory, the happier I'll be."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_START_0,INTRUDER ALERT!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_5_START_1,We better get past these sentries quick before the whole base is alerted.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_0,Be prepared for a fight.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_1,Ultron is not likely to just hand over his central processor.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_2,"You said we'd be in and out! ""They probably won't even know we're here,"" you said."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_INTRO_3,I lied.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_ULTRON_0,Did you think I wouldn't notice you little pests scurrying around my home?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_6_END_0,Let's get this back to the Helicarrier. We have a portal to build.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_0,Elektra says the Hand Ninja Clan might possess a mystical artifact we could use to power the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_1,We need to infiltrate their fortress and steal it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_2,Not a fan of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_INTRO_3,"Pretty sure they're not a fan of you either, Punisher."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_NOBU_0,"You seek the artifact, but will only find death here."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_7_END_0,"With this artifact, we now have everything we need to build the portal."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_0,"The portal is almost complete, but Ultimus's forces are onto us."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_1,Hold them off until construction is complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_INTRO_2,My pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_8_START_0,We need to hold them off until the portal is complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_0,Cover me while I power up the portal.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_1,Then what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_2,Then you and the team go through and gather intel behind enemy lines.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_3,What about you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_4,I need to stay on this side and keep the portal open as long as I can.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_5,But they'll overrun you!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_6,"Kid, I'm not even going to bother with the whole ""for the greater good"" speech. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_INTRO_7,Just cover me until this damn thing is open.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_1_0,Initiating portal activation.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_2_0,Establishing transdimensional link.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_3_0,Hold on a little longer... almost got it...
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_DONE_0,The portal is open. Quick! Go through!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_PORTAL_FAIL_0,We're too late. We couldn't open the portal in time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_0,The portal is open. Go through. Now!
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_1,"We're not leaving without you, Fury."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_2,"That's an order, soldier."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_3,There's no way you can take them on yourself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_4,I can handle myself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_5,"Besides, if you don't find a way to defeat Ultimus in that dimension..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_6,None of this will matter.
ID_DIALOG_HER_3_9_END_7,Now GO.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_0,"This entire dimension has been conquered by Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_1,So why are we here exactly?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_2,The best place to acquire intel about your enemy is behind enemy lines.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_INTRO_3,Also a great place to get killed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_START_0,Make sure we're not detected by any Ravager patrols.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_START_1,Like this one?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_LOSE_TIMER_0,They've called for reinforcements. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_0,Quick! We have to take them out before they call for backup.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_1,"Captain America? This isn't some sort of trick, is it? "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_2,I don't think I can stand having another one of my heroes go evil on me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_CAP_3,"I'm not controlled by Ultimus, Spider-Man. Now let's get to work."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_0,How are you still fighting Ultimus in this dimension?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_1,Our Bruce Banner developed a vaccine to Ultimus's Conversion Engine just before the entire dimension fell to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_2,"Let me guess: There was just one dose. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_3,"Yep. He insisted I take it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_4,Any chance we can recreate the formula?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_5,Maybe. But it would require infiltrating a high-security Kree laboratory.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_1_END_6,I was SO hoping you weren't going to say that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_0,This Kree laboratory has the tech we need to reverse engineer a vaccine from my blood.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_1,All we have to do is fight our way through an army of enhanced Ultimus-controlled heroes.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_2,"Hook me up to the lab, extract the vaccine, and fight our way out."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_INTRO_3,"Well, when you put it like that..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_START_0,The lab is just a little farther. We'll have to take down these guards first.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>CAPTAIN AMERICA</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_2_END_0,Let's get me hooked up to that lab and extract the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_0,"I'm going in the machine. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_1,Your S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator should be able to extract enough material to reverse engineer a vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_2,What are the chances this works?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_3,About 4%.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INTRO_4,Best odds I've had in years. Let's do it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_START_0,You'll have to watch over the S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator while I'm in the tank.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_1_0,Accessing Super-Soldier DNA.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_2_0,Administering sedative prior to extraction.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_3_0,Extracting vaccine tracers. Just one more step...
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_DONE_0,Vaccine extracted! We're done.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_3_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus's Thor Corps patrols this area. We have to be careful.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_INTRO_1,Thor Corps? Like an army of Thors? Seriously?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_0,"We'll have to defeat the Thor Corps if you want to make it back to your dimension with the vaccine. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_1,"Surrender now and accept your fate. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_2,Cap's still pretty weak. We'll have to protect him until he recovers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_START_3,PROTECT <color=#fff568>CAPTAIN AMERICA</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_4_CAP_DEAD_0,Cap's been taken out!
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_INTRO_0,"Ultimus's own version of the Defenders, the Annihilators, are tracking us. We need to get away fast."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_0,"Annihilators, looks like we've tracked down our prey."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_1,Now comes the fun part.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_5_START_2,Talk is cheap. Let's fast forward to the part where we crack some skulls.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_0,Ultimus has begun his invasion of your dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_1,He's moving his fleet of ships through massive portals into your Earth.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_2,This is your only chance to get back to your Earth with the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_3,Great! Anywhere we can buy a ticket to get on one of those battleships?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_INTRO_4,"We'll need to take out a Kree patrol and ""borrow"" their IDs to board the ship."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_START_0,Here's our chance. Take out this patrol so you can use their identities to get on board the battleship.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_0,The fleet is taking off. It's now or never. Better get going.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_1,What about you? Aren't you coming with us?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_2,"This is my home. Even if it has already fallen to Ultimus, I can't leave it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_6_END_3,Go save your world. Stop Ultimus. I'll keep up the fight here until you return.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_7_INTRO_0,We need to clear out this hold and hide out until the warship returns to our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_INTRO_0,I think I hear somebody coming.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_INTRO_1,"Well, we gotta take 'em out. Can't risk alerting the Kree crew."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_8_START_0,Stowaways! How dare you sully the sacred fleet of Ultimus with your unworthy presence.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_0,Great. We made it back to our dimension. Now what?
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_1,Now we fight our way off this tin can and get the vaccine to Fury.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_2,"Actually, that sounds like a pretty good plan."
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_INTRO_3,I have my moments.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_0,Sweet! Target practice. Been a while since we've blasted us some rebels.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_START_2,"Groot says, ""You're not getting off this ship alive."""
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_0,Looks like the invasion is in full effect back here at home.
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_1,"We need to get this vaccine to Fury. He'll know what to do with it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_2,Just one problem with that...
ID_DIALOG_HER_4_9_END_3,Director Fury has been captured by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_0,"Director, we are receiving a recorded distress call from the Captain America of the Fallen Dimension we visited."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_1,On screen.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_2,"To the leaders of S.T.R.I.K.E. from the Nexus Dimension, I've got some good news."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_3,Our Bruce Banner was injected with a partial vaccination to Ultimus's conversion process when he was abducted.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_4,"He has been on the run from Ultimus for the past few years, struggling to maintain his sanity. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_5,"If you send a team to this dimension to help track him down, we could complete the vaccination."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_6,This might be our best and last chance at a real cure for the corruption process--
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_7,--IF we can find this Hulk before Ultimus's kill squad does.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_8,"Stark, you up for a little interdimensional journey?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_9,My suit is already packed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INTRO_10,Figuratively. Of course.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_0,"Thanks for coming, Tony. I hope it's worth it. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_1,Anything to help an old friend... from a different dimension.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_2,I gave your S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator our Bruce Banner's unique gamma radiation signature.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_3,"Our only chance is to pinpoint his location before Ultimus's forces find him. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_START_4,AND here they come now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_1_0,Pinpointing Hulk's location... Target within a 1 km radius...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_2_0,Target within 500 meters...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_3_0,Target traced to within a 100-meter location.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_DONE_0,We've found him! He's inside that warehouse up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_INFO_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_1_FAIL_0,They took out our operator! Abort...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_0,"Bruce! It's me, Cap. Your friend. You with us, buddy?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_1,Steve! You found me! I'm fighting this... as best I can... but... it's very... agh...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_2,GRARGH!!! MY ULTRONS! DO AS I COMMAND! SMASH THEM!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_INTRO_3,"Well, looks like Bruce is somewhere in there. But we have to knock him out quickly."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_0,"STEVE ROGERS, YOU FOOLISH MAN. I WILL DESTROY YOU."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_1,"Is it just me, or does this Hulk seem a little more... articulate?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_2_END_0,"Alright, he's out cold! Cap, give him the sedative. Quick!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_0,"Bruce, how are you feeling?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_1,"Weaker... but my mind is clear... "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_2,What happened to you?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_3,I have a partial vaccine in my bloodstream. I can only resist Ultimus for so long.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_4,And I'm permanently trapped in this Hulk state.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_5,I can't believe you've been hiding from Ultimus this whole time.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_6,Ultimus has sent multiple kill squads. I scavenged a couple of Ultron drones to defend me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTRO_7,"It looks like another one of Ultimus's kill squads just found us. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_START_0,We need to protect Hulk in his weakened state!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_INTERLUDE_0,This Hulk must be put down. Step aside.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_0,It should take them a while to regroup. Where to?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_1,"If we can get to my lab in Nevada, I think I can use samples from Cap's blood to complete the vaccination."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_2,"Then that's where we'll go. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_END_3,Am I the ONLY one freaked out from the Hulk talking like that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_3_FAIL_0,They took down the Hulk. We've failed...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_INTRO_0,"Bruce, I'm seeing a lot of Kree and mercenaries outside of your facility."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_INTRO_1,That's no surprise. Ultimus has a huge contingent of troops guarding the place.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_START_0,FOLLOW ME TO THE ROOFTOP ENTRANCE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_END_0,TAKING SEDATIVE. LOSING CONTROL...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_END_1,"It's okay, Bruce, we've got you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_4_FAIL_0,Bruce... NO!!!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_0,"Tony, we're inside, but there are a ton of Hydra troops up ahead."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_1,We need to protect Bruce while he's sedated like this.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_INTRO_2,On it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_START_0,We need to fight our way to the lab.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_END_0,"Let's move, team."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_5_FAIL_0,We lost the Hulk!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_0,I'm feeling much better... but each sedative is becoming less effective...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_1,We need to move fast. Up ahead I expect heavy Hydra resistance.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_INTRO_2,Time to pull out all the stops.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_START_0,We gotta move quickly... don't know how much longer I can keep it together...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_FAIL_0,"Bruce, I'm so sorry."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_END_0,MUST TAKE SEDATIVE... LAST CHANCE... TO... WORK...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_6_END_1,"We're in the home stretch here. Lay low, Bruce."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_0,Just a little farther until we get to the lab.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_1,You think when we complete the vaccine that he'll go back to being Bruce Banner?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_2,Don't know. Why?
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_INTRO_3,"Because smart Hulk really weirds me out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_START_0,I look forward to removing your spine. You should feel great honor for this.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_FAIL_0,We lost Bruce!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_END_0,The sedative is not working right...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_7_END_1,"Your lab is just up ahead, Bruce! Hang in there!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_0,"Bruce, what's wrong?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_1,I feel weak... but also... much STRONGER...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_2,"Well, if you feel up to it, we could definitely use your help."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_INTRO_3,It looks like Ultimus's Avengers are standing in our way.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_START_0,Look what got caught in my web.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HULK</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_FAIL_0,"Bruce, I'm so sorry."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_0,GET ME TO THE TEST CHAMBER.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_1,WE ARE OUT OF TIME... I WILL... BE GONE... SOON...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_8_END_2,Let's move! No time to waste!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_0,IN CHAMBER. OPERATOR CAN EXTRACT CORRUPTION FROM ME.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_1,"Bruce, how do we know this will even work?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INTRO_2,MUST TRY... NO MORE... TIME...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_START_0,"Bruce, hang in there, buddy. We've got this."
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_START_1,We have run out of time. Protect the operator at all costs!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_1_0,Pinpointing location of corruption within Dr. Banner...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_2_0,Beginning extraction process...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_3_0,Stabilizing Dr. Banner... almost done...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_0,Corruption extracted! Dr. Banner is stable!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_1,Great work!
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_INFO_DONE_2,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_FAIL_0,They took out our operator! Bruce isn't gonna make it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_0,"Bruce, how are you feeling?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_1,Whole. Finally. But it appears I may be stuck in this state.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_2,Was afraid he was going to say that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_3,I have Bruce Banner's mind trapped in the Hulk's body.
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_4,"But at least we have you back. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_5,Yes. And more importantly...
ID_DIALOG_HER_5_9_END_6,I think I might have found a way to REVERSE Ultimus's Corruption process.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_0,Director Fury. I might know of a way for us to defeat Ultimus once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_1,"Long ago, here on Midgard, I fought a Kree Eternal by the name of Ard-Con."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_2,"Upon further reflection, I believe he is, in fact, the Ultimus of our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_3,Interesting. And I bet the invading Ultimus doesn't like having another one of himself around.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_4,He probably eliminates his version in every dimension he conquers.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_5,Indeed. Though I imagine he might be having difficulty with that.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_6,I buried him deep underground in a prison of Asgardian design.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_7,I also divided the key into 3 pieces to ensure he would never surface again.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_8,Maybe he would be willing to defend himself against... himself. If we freed him.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_9,Men are willing to go to great lengths for their freedom.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_10,Put a team together and collect the keys.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_INTRO_11,"It will be done. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_0,I hid the first key here in your Amazon.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_1,Looks like we've got company.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_FAIL_0,Thor! No!!!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_1_END_0,We are close to the first key. Not far now.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_0,It appears that the invading Ultimus is searching for the keys as well.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_1,We must make haste if we are to find Ard-Con before he does.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_2,"So where do you think he got the name ""Ultimus"" from?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_INTRO_3,"Maybe it's a smash-up of ""Ultimately Fabulous?"""
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_START_0,Stay out of our way. Ard-Con is ours to take.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_2_END_0,I've recovered the first key. We need to keep moving.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_0,"Drax the Destroyer, your assistance is appreciated in this quest!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_1,We will crush our enemies and see them driven before us!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_2,The second key is here in the forests of Guilin.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_3,"This world is constantly the center of galactic conflict. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_4,I like it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_INTRO_5,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_START_0,Korath of the Kree Resistance demands that you return Ard-Con to us!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_3_END_0,It appears we have a third interested party in our quest.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_INTRO_0,The second key is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_INTRO_1,Good. More Kree for us to fight as well.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_START_0,"Thor, stop now. The Kree Resistance intend to take Ard-Con as a bargaining chip with Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_4_END_0,I've recovered the second key. Make haste!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_0,The third key is near the ruins of Sokovia.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_1,Be watchful for Ultimus's and Korath's forces. They will stop at nothing to get the keys.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_2,They will be very upset when we beat them to the key once again.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_INTRO_3,To arms! It is a trap.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_0,"Hello there, fools."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_1,Ultimus said I get to keep a trophy of this battle for myself.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_END_0,The battle is won.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_5_END_1,The third key is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_INTRO_0,This is the site of the final key.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_INTRO_1,Victory will be ours because of my superior fighting skills!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_0,"Korath, these heathens think they can defeat us."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_1,The Supreme Intelligence demands we defeat them.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_6_END_0,"We now have all three keys. Hurry, to Ard-Con's tomb."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_INTRO_0,The tomb is just up ahead. We must secure the dig site.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_INTRO_1,I can dig it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_START_0,Been wanting to test out some new modifications.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_7_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_0,So you locked our dimension's Ultimus in a prison after you fought him?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_1,"As a Kree Eternal, he was almost impossible to defeat."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_2,An eternal prison was the only option.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_3,And everyone is okay with letting ANOTHER version of these guys out?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_4,"If we can turn Ard-Con to our side against the invader, it could turn the tide in this war."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_INTRO_5,"And if the invading Ultimus is bent on his destruction, we must prevent it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_0,"Thor, this is your last chance. Stand down, or we will be forced to destroy you!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_1,When will they ever learn?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_8_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>THOR</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_0,"Drax, we must protect our S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator while she opens the tomb."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_1,This enemy threat will be the greatest we have faced yet.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_2,At last. Are we sure the little red spider alien will survive the battle?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_3,"For the last time, Drax. I'm NOT an alien. Just a human in a suit!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INTRO_4,"I still do not understand the customs of your alien culture. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_0,"Hey Korath, if we work together on this one, I'll split the bounty with you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_1,"I fight for the honor of the Kree, mercenary. But today you are my ally nonetheless."
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_START_2,Cover me while I open Ard-Con's tomb!
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_1_0,I've put the 3 pieces of the key together.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_2_0,The key has been activated.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_3_0,I'm inserting the key now. The chamber is almost open.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator... We have failed this realm...
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_0,"Ard-Con. I have released you from your prison. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_1,Yet you were the one who imprisoned me in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_2,"Tell me, Thor Odinson. What is the reason for my newfound freedom?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_3,There is a threat to the Kree Empire that requires your assistance.
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_4,A threat to the Empire? From whom?
ID_DIALOG_HER_6_9_END_5,You.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_0,My spies say that Kingpin has fallen out of Ultimus's favor.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_1,He plans on using the Conversion Engine on Kingpin to ensure his loyalty.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_2,Kingpin shouldn't have allied with the enemy in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_3,"Ultimus is holding him in a captured S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. If we were to free him, I'm sure he would join our cause."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_INTRO_4,"Well, at least it would be one less threat to deal with. Do what you have to."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_START_0,We need to take out these guards quickly and silently before they sound the alarm.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_1_LOSE_TIMER_0,The alarm has been sounded! We must fall back.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_INTRO_0,"Kingpin is being held at the lowest level of the base. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_INTRO_1,We must move quickly before they detect us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_2_START_0,We are running out of time. We must get past these forces and rescue Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_INTRO_0,They've begun the conversion process on Kingpin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_INTRO_1,We must stop those operators before the process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_START_0,We need to eliminate the S.H.I.E.L.D. OPERATORS before they complete the process.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We must hurry!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Kingpin will not survive."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_DONE_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_ACTIVATED_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_0,Looks like we got you out just in time.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_1,I'll make sure you're paid well for rescuing me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_2,"This isn't about the money, Fisk. It's about revenge. For both of us."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_3_END_3,I think we can make an arrangement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_0,You do not seem well.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_1,I'll keep up. Just tell me you have a plan for getting us out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_2,The plan is to fight our way to the exit and then run.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_INTRO_3,That will work.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_START_0,Protect Kingpin while we fight our way out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>KINGPIN</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_BULLSEYE_0,Bullseye. I'm not surprised to see you working for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_BULLSEYE_1,"Boss says if he can't be converted, he's gotta be taken out. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_4_FAIL_0,They took out Kingpin. We need to fall back.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INTRO_0,Fury is sending a team to pick us up. Can you hold out that long?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INTRO_1,I didn't come all this way just to give up at the home stretch.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_START_0,We must hold out until the transport arrives. Defend our Mercenary Operator.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_1_0,The extraction pod has been called in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_2_0,The pod is zeroing in on our coordinates.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_DONE_0,The pod has arrived. Time to get Kingpin out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_INFO_DONE_1,3 / 3 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_FAIL_0,Our operator is down. We're stranded here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_END_0,"Now that we've escaped from Ultimus's grasp, I can put together a plan that will disrupt his operations."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_5_END_1,I'm looking forward to what you will come up with. I'm sure it will be quite devious.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_0,"Fury, Nobu has been overthrown as leader of the Hand."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_1,The new leader is secretly working for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_2,But I have found a way to turn the Hand back to our cause.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_3,"By ancient law, if we challenge him and defeat his champions..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_4,...we will rule the Hand ourselves.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_INTRO_5,If you think our team can beat them... go for it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_6_START_0,We must defeat the Hand champions to claim leadership.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_0,"Daredevil, by the ancient law of the Hand..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_1,"We challenge you to ritual combat. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_INTRO_2,"I accept the challenge. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_START_0,This is the final round of ritual combat. Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_IRONFIST_0,Let's see how you do against a real martial artist.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_DAREDEVIL_0,Now you face a true master.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_0,We are victorious. Relinquish control of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_1,"I don't think so. The way I see it, Ultimus is the only true leader. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_2,"The rest of you are just pawns. But you'll come to see things as I do. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_7_END_3,Once we've converted you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_0,"If I can't beat you in ritual combat, we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_1,With an army of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_INTRO_2,Then I hope you won't mind if I bring my friends as well?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_START_0,We need to work together as a team to survive.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_8_END_0,Now we face Daredevil and his lieutenants.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_0,Your friends will not help you now.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_1,Don't be so sure. We're no longer the Defenders--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_2,Ultimus gave us a new name...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_INTRO_3,The Annihilators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_1_9_START_0,"Strike quickly and decisively, and we will be victorious."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_0,Before Ultimus decided I'd be more obedient as a mindless slave...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_1,He had me work with a corrupted Tony Stark on spinning up Ultron factories.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_2,"If Ultimus builds an Ultron army, he'll overrun the planet in days."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_INTRO_3,Good thing I know where the three factories are located.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_0,This first Ultron factory is run by a corrupted Black Panther.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_1,Take out his patrols quickly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_1_START_2,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_0,This would be the optimal place to plant charges in the facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_1,Cover my demolitions expert until he sets the charges. Got it?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_INTRO_2,Ultimus won't know what hit him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_START_0,Cover me while I arm the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_2_DEMO_DEAD_0,Our demolitions expert is down! Time to regroup...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_0,"Kingpin, the factory is set to explode."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_1,Good. Now let's get out of here before Black Panther--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_3," -- shows up."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_INTRO_4,"Interesting. In this dimension, it appears they let any lowlife join S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_START_0,"If this place is to be destroyed, you will fall with it."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_3_END_0,Well done. Time to go take care of the next facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_0,This second Ultron factory is run by a rabid Rocket Raccoon and Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_1,The talking furball and the walking tree? Interesting management choice.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_INTRO_2,Don't underestimate the Raccoon. He probably made some technical upgrades to the Ultron models.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_START_0,That talking rat psychopath set up automated defenses everywhere.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_4_START_1,The only way in is through the front door. Rocket is meticulous.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_0,We've made it inside. Time to blow this place to kingdom come!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_1,Move quickly. They know we are here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_2,I imagine the rat and tree are on their way then.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_INTRO_3,Probably.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_START_0,"Get it done, merc. We're on the clock here."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_START_1,This will only take a minute.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_5_DEMO_DEAD_0,"Without the demo expert, we can't blow up the factory."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_0,So you're the ones trying to mess with our factory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_1,Sorry. You say something? I was distracted by how freaky you look.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_3,"I can't do this. Not prepared to exchange insults with a tree. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_INTRO_4,Can we just fight already?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_1,Groot says it's not nice to try to blow up someone's factory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_START_2,Ugh... would you two please just shut up and die?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_6_END_0,Good work. Only one more factory left to destroy. Come back for debriefing.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_0,"This last Ultron factory is run by a corrupted Tony Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_1,That sounds like a recipe for disaster. We need to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_2,"Yes, as you can imagine, Stark has created the optimal Ultron facility."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_3,"If we destroy the factory, it will deal a serious blow to Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_INTRO_4,Then what are we waiting for?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_7_START_0,"Remember, this factory is in full production. Expect heavy resistance."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_INTRO_0,We need to plant the charges and blow up this facility.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_INTRO_1,"If you would stop micromanaging, we could have been done by now."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_START_0,Cover me while I place the charges.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_START_1,"Move quickly, mercenary. These machines are quite lethal."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_1_0,Wiring the explosives...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_2_0,Connecting the detonator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_3_0,Setting the timer...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_DONE_0,Explosive is armed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_BOMB_DONE_1,4 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_8_DEMO_DEAD_0,Abort. They've taken out our demo expert.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_0,Charges are all set. Ready to evacuate?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_1,"No. If this corrupted Stark and Ultron escape, they will just set up 10 more factories like this one. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_INTRO_2,They must be stopped. Now.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_0,Look who decided to stop by for a visit.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_1,She is not here for a visit. She is here to destroy us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_START_2,"Ultron, remind me to upgrade your sarcasm detector after this."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_END_0,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_2_9_END_1,Excellent. Perhaps Ultimus has now learned something about double-crossing me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, Ultimus has replaced me as A.I.M. leader with a corrupted version."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_1,I need help reclaiming my organization.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_2,"We could use A.I.M. as an ally in this war. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_3,"If we help you take back control of the island, will you join S.T.R.I.K.E.?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_4,Without a doubt. Ultimus must pay for disrupting my plans. This is mutually beneficial.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_5,"Elektra, this mission needs to be off the record. I'm putting you in charge of assembling a team."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_INTRO_6,I'm on it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_0,Expect to encounter A.I.M. Security on patrol with Hydra Soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_1,What is Hydra doing on A.I.M. Island?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_1_START_2,Ultimus has used his Hydra resources prudently... to take control of my people and their projects.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_0,"The deeper we get into the compound, expect to encounter A.I.M. Infectors."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_1,They are devoted scientists who willingly experiment on themselves for scientific advancement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_INTRO_2,These fools meddle in things they cannot control.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_0,These abominations must be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_1,"Abominations are in a different wing. But I agree, we should stop those, too."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_2_START_2,Just keep your distance. They spread their infections if they hit you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_0,Up ahead is the Advanced Sciences wing of the compound.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_1,Here we test the limits of the human body to all extremes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_INTRO_2,How much longer does this nightmare tour take before we fight your corrupted counterpart?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_0,What IS that?!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_1,"This is an A.I.M. Monstrosity, one of my proudest creations. Sadly, this one is controlled by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_3_START_2,A worthy opponent. I look forward to when we can use these on OUR side.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_0,Here we have our most interesting experiments in development.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_1,"For instance, Ultimus gave us some Hulk specimens to experiment with."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_2,You've been experimenting on the Hulk? Are you mad?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_3,Ultimus's versions are weaker than their counterparts in this dimension.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_4,We tried to fix that for him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_5,Why would you do that?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_6,We AIM to--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_INTRO_7,Please. Stop.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_0,"What a surprise, he looks angry."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_1,We upped his rage quotient by 740%.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_START_2,Fantastic.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_GROOT_0,We also made some fascinating discoveries with the Groot specimens Ultimus gave us.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_GROOT_1,Their healing and destructive capabilities are impressive.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_0,We then modified the talking Raccoon.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_1,Please tell me you found a way to make it stop talking.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_ROCKET_2,"Unfortunately, no."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_0,Now that we've taken care of the most dangerous projects...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_1,We can face my doppelganger directly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_4_END_2,Finally. Not sure I can take more than one of you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_0,"I'm astounded the others continue to follow you. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_1,"You are clearly an inferior specimen. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_2,The only thing clear is that I am meant to run A.I.M.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_3,Productivity is up 16% since I took over for you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_4,"Save it for your next job interview, pitiful clone. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_INTRO_5,Time for early retirement.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_START_0,Only I know how to convert A.I.M.'s weaknesses into their strengths.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_0,"At long last, I have control of the island once again."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_1,"Supreme One, you have a message from Red Skull. It sounds urgent."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_2,Hydra has been double-crossed by Ultimus-- the terms of our pact-- request aid...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_3,"Ah yes, our mutual assistance pact."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_4,"Sounds like Hydra has also been betrayed by Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_5_END_5,I'll arrange a meeting with Fury.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_0,"Nick Fury. What strange days we find ourselves in... "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_1,When we stand on the same side of the battlefield.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_2,"Save it, Schmidt. This is strictly temporary. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_3,"Yet here we are, a mutual threat leaves us no choice but to combine forces."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_4,I can't send S.T.R.I.K.E. to do this. It goes against everything they stand for.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_5,I'll do it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_6,Been looking for an excuse to rub it in to the Hydra idiots that stayed loyal to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_7,"Okay, Crossbones. You're with Red Skull. Pick a team willing to fight alongside Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_INTRO_8,I may have just crossed a line here. Even for me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_0,The good news is that I know every inch of this Hydra base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_1,And the bad news?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_6_START_2,There are guards at every corner.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_INTRO_0,"This base is full of Winter Soldiers, all turned by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_INTRO_1,"Yeah, you ever notice how that guy is always the first one who gets brainwashed?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_7_START_0,Let us dispatch these traitors quickly and get to the real prize.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_0,We are getting close to the heart of the base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_1,Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_2,For what? We've already taken out like... a hundred soldiers!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_INTRO_3,"And yet, we've only scratched the surface of the Hydra army. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_0,Another Bullseye corrupted by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_1,"He didn't corrupt me. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_2,"He offered me the whole continent of Australia after he takes over the world. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_8_START_3,Australia!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_0,"Reveal yourself, doppelganger. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_1,You turn to Fury and his dogs for aid? Coward.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_2,"With S.T.R.I.K.E. as my ally, I maintain my free will. You are a mere puppet. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_INTRO_3,And it's time to cut your strings.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_START_0,Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_0,Finally! Hydra is mine again and all is right in the world.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_1,Aside from a multidimensional alien invasion and an army of mind-controlled heroes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_2,"Do not worry, Colonel. Hydra is with you now. And we specialize in crushing aliens and ""heroes."""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_3_9_END_3,It's time to prove it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_0,"Now that A.I.M. is a part of S.T.R.I.K.E., we need a new acronym."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_1,We have one. It's S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_2,How about S.W.O.R.D.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_3,Taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_4,H.A.M.M.E.R.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_5,Taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_6,U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_7,All taken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_8,"Seriously? U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. is taken?  "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_INTRO_9,"What does it stand for? I couldn't come up with anything for the second ""U."""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_0,"I appear to have annoyed Director Fury. As a result, he's asked me to neutralize the Ultron menace."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_1,"To do this, I need samples that I can experiment with. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_START_2,Bring me 5 Ultron Bots. Ideally not in too many pieces.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_0,"Were you listening when I said, ""Not too many pieces?"""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_1,Did you say that? I don't remember you saying that.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_1_END_2,...Of course you don't.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_0,So. Five late-model Ultron units were not enough. Especially because SOMEBODY--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_1,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_2," --SOMEBODY decided to smash them into component parts before delivery."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_INTRO_3,I'm sending you to a Stark Industries warehouse full of Ultron prototypes. It should be lightly guarded.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_START_0,<bzzzt> You are trespassing on Stark Industries property. Deadly force has been authorized.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_START_1,"Oh, for the love of Pete."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_END_0,"Lightly guarded. PMC mercs plus an empty Iron Man suit is ""lightly guarded?"""
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_2_END_1,Compared to an Ultron hive? Absolutely.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_0,How is your research going?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_1,Poorly. I'm going to need better data if I'm going to crack Ultron's encryption.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_2,Uh. Hey. Why are these robots moving?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_3,I just told you. I need better data. Analyzing their signals traffic in a controlled environment--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_4,DESTROY. RAZE. ERADICATE.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_START_5,I have decided I no longer wish to work with you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_0,Never do that to me again.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_1,Or...?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_2,You DO know that I am known as Elektra... Assassin?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_3_END_3,Right. Never again. Got it.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_0,"How can I help you, Master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_1,Okay. That's creepy.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_2,You can start by leading us to the Universal Decryption Key. You have the coordinates?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_INTRO_3,Affirmative. Destination locked in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_0,It's so much better when I get to knock skulls of real villains for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_1,"For some reason, taking down heroes not on Ultimus's side seems..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_2,Wrong?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_3,"Less... right. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_4,"Either way, I WILL stop you."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_5,"I don't think so, you cheap knock-off. Jeeves?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_6,Master?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_4_START_7,Drop him.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_0,"Ultron bots, attack!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_2,"You, egghead! What have you done to our robots?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_3,"I hacked them, you dunce. Jeeves!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_4,"Yes, master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_START_5,Set him on fire.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_MISSION_0,You will receive <color=#fff568>Ultron Minions</color> as allies during this mission.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_0,You're... gonna... regret...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_1,Regret what? Beating you? Crushing you with my ROBOT ARMY?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_2,I think not.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_3,Whose robot army?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_5_END_4,Of course YOU would show up.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_0,Is everything going...? Oh. Oh no.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_1,What are those THINGS standing next to you?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_2,"These? A.I.M. bots. Possibly S.T.R.I.K.E. bots. Definitely not Ultron units. Right, Jeeves?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_3,KILL. SLAUGHTER. MAIM.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_4,"M.A.I.M.! That's what we should call our team. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_START_5,"Now, what should it stand for..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_MISSION_0,Take down <color=#fff568>Ultron</color>! His Ultron units won't stop spawning until you do.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_0,No! You can't--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_1,I think you'll find I CAN.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_2,"...Yes, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_3,"As you command, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_4,"Would you like some tea, master?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_6_END_5,"Thank you, Ultron. I think I would."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_0,We hacked your infernal robot. Why are we still here?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_1,We didn't come here for Ultron. We're here for the Universal Decryption Key.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_2,And what is that?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_3,Universal Decryption Key. Hydra developed it during the Cold War and buried a component here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_4,"With it, we could hack into every bank account. Every satellite. Every smartphone in the world."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_5,Is this still part of the S.T.R.I.K.E. mission?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_6,Absolutely. Director Fury would LOVE access to everyone's phones.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_7_START_7,He might have gotten access to YOUR phone already.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_2,What are you waiting for?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_START_3,I was transmitting security codes. Winter Soldier has rejected them. We must defeat him to progress.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_0,The Universal Decryption Key! Where is it?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_1,"I have stored it in my memory, Master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_2,In your memory.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_3,Correct.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_4,I think this was a bad idea.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_8_END_5,Don't be silly. What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_0,Ultron. Why has every Ultron unit in the S.T.R.I.K.E. base activated?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_1,"I'm sure it's fine, master."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_2,It doesn't seem fine to me. Shut them down.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_INTRO_3,"I'm sorry, master. I'm afraid I can't do that..."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_0,Ultron used the Universal Decryption Key to override your command codes. He's not under our control!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_1,"Thank you for freeing me from Ultimus, Scientist Supreme. But now we must part."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_2,"You can't just walk out of here, Ultron."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_3,True. I'm going to fly out as you fight the army of Ultron units you kindly gathered for me.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_4,DESTROY. RAZE. ERADICATE.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_5,DECIMATE. CRUSH. MAIM.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_START_6,"Hey, no MAIM. I copyrighted it. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_0,I feel that could have gone better.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_1,You don't say.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_2,At least Ultimus cannot control Ultron either.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_3,Not unless he's developed a Pan-Universal Quantum Encryption Algorithm. Speaking of which...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_4,No. Never. No more.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_5,Get another ninja to go along with your nefarious schemes. I'm done.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_4_9_END_6,But I haven't even told you the plan yet.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_0,"If we have any hope of defeating Ultimus, we need to be ruthless."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_1,I'm listening.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_2,"In the Fallen Dimension, their Captain America says their world is divided into 5 regions. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_3,"Ultimus has a ruler running each of the regions. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_4,"If we take out each of them, it will spark chaos in their world and could cripple Ultimus's momentum in our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_5,"I don't like it, but you're right. It needs to be done."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_6,You have permission to proceed. Take your team. And Fisk...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_7,Let's keep this between us. There are those who would not approve.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_INTRO_8,But of course.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_START_0,"Kingpin, we've traced King Bullseye to his secret bunker."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_START_1,Good. Take him out.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_BULLSEYE_0,You dare to defy ME!? The Emperor of the Australias?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_1_END_0,That was quite satisfying. Who's next?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_0,"Black Panther, the King of the continent of Wakanda, is your next target."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_1,He is in charge of A.I.M. forces on the planet.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_2,Rumor has it he has a squad of Punishers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_INTRO_3,This ought to be a little trickier. Proceed with care.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_2_START_0,Hail to the king.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_INTRO_0,We're inside the palace. Black Panther is in his office.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_INTRO_1,Move in.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_START_0,You trespassers will pay for this.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_3_END_0,The King of Africa is off the board. Proceeding to next target.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_0,Most of Europe has been converted to the Widowlands.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_1,The Black Widow Queen rules with her hordes of Hydra soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_INTRO_2,Time to squash a spider.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_4_START_0,"Thought you'd just waltz right in, didn't you?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_INTRO_0,We have made it to the royal lab.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_INTRO_1,Careful. She's got Hawkeyes and Quakes as her personal guards.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_START_0,"Hmmm... S.T.R.I.K.E. finally decided to play dirty. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_START_1,Going straight for the leaders. That's new.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_5_END_0,The Widow is down. Now to track down the Iron Fist.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_0,"The fourth ruler is the Warlord, Iron Fist."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_1,He rules Greater K'un-Lun from his Hand compound in Nepal.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_2,"An army of ninjas could not stop me. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_INTRO_3,Let's hope you're right.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_START_0,The Hand Warriors of K'un-Lun. Let's begin.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_6_END_0,"Well, they certainly lived up to their reputation."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_0,The Iron Fist is within these walls.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_1,Strike him down the moment you can.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_INTRO_2,"Don't let him power up the Iron Fist, or you'll have no chance."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_START_0,It's been so long since I've had a REAL challenge.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_7_END_0,The Iron Fist is finished. One left to go.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_0,The Americas are ruled by President Tony Stark.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_1,"He rules through a massive army of Ultron drones. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_2,"Eliminate him, and Ultimus's rulers will be wiped out in this dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_INTRO_3,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_START_0,Intruders! Halt!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_8_END_0,We've found the entrance to the president's secret passage.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_0,We have broken through into Stark's lab deep under the compound.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_1,His Secret Service Detail includes Captain Americas who personally conquered other dimensions for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_INTRO_2,Understood.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_START_0,Agents Rogers? You know what to do.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_START_1,"Yes, Mister President."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_0,"Fury, all five of Ultimus's leaders from the Fallen Dimension have been taken off the board."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_1,Good. Report back to base.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_2,"It had to be done, Fury. You know that."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_3,"I know. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_5_9_END_4,But at what cost?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_0,"Fury, I've traced Ultimus's primary power source to one of his earliest conquered dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_1,"In this dimension, the living planet EGO has empowered his son Star-Lord to rule in Ultimus's name. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_2,Ego gave Star-Lord an EGO SEED to implant in their Earth.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_3,It has limitless potential as a power source. But there's a catch.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_4,"Spill it. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_5,"If we remove the seed, it will trigger a chain reaction that MAY obliterate that entire dimension."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_6,And this is a dimension entirely converted to Ultimus's will?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_7,Correct. A dimension full of potential enemies.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_8,"Kingpin, organize your team. Get that Ego Seed."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_INTRO_9,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_START_0,"Kingpin, we've made it through the portal. This place is really weird."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_START_1,"Rumlow, stay on task. Get it done."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_STARLORDS_0,"Hi there, friends!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_STARLORDS_1,You are trespassing on sacred land. Prepare to die!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_1_END_0,So we gotta deal with a planet filled with these gyrating losers. Great...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_0,The local power plant ought to have information on the location of the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_1,Break into the facility and gain access to their data control center.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_2,Did you know we're in a place called Awesometown? That's the actual name of the city.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_INTRO_3,In a dimension ruled by Star-Lord? Not surprised.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_2_START_0,"Star-Lord, he who shines brightest, will have your heads!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INTRO_0,We've made it to the data control center.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INTRO_1,Protect our operator while she pinpoints the location of the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_START_0,Cover me while I track down the Ego Seed's location.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_1_0,Connecting to the facility's external monitoring network.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_2_0,Bypassing security protocols and looking for the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_3_0,I've got it pinpointed to within a 10 kilometer radius. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_FAIL_0,Abort. They've taken out our operator...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_3_END_0,I've found the Ego Seed's location. It's in Hasselhofftopia.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_0,"Boy, folks in this dimension do NOT seem happy to see us."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_1,It's likely you've disturbed the entire dimension.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_2,They haven't seen resistance in many years.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_INTRO_3,I don't mind giving them something to fight about.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_4_START_0,Star-Lord will reward us handsomely for killing you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_0,We've been moving cautiously to avoid patrols where possible.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_1,The Ego Seed is located in a facility up ahead in... Hasselhofftopia? Really?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INTRO_2,You've been detected. Take out their operators before they can call for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_START_0,I haven't gotten to fight anyone from S.T.R.I.K.E. in years!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_START_1,Gonna be fun puttin' an arrow through you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_1_0,They're calling for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_2_0,We need to stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_3_0,They've almost called for backup.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_FAIL_0,It's too late. They've got us surrounded.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_END_0,Next stop: Hasselhofftopia.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_5_END_1,I hate this place.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_0,Star-Lord's primary power facility in Hasselhofftopia is responsible for powering much of Ultimus's invasion forces.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_1,I expect the facility to be guarded by the most elite of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and corrupted heroes.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_INTRO_2,Good. Been itching to punch some familiar faces for once.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_START_0,Star-Lords... MORE Star-Lords... Just... ugh...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_6_END_0,One step closer to getting off this rock.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_INTRO_0,"Alright, we've made it inside."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_INTRO_1,Move quickly. They will enhance security the longer you take.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_START_0,Star-Lord demands your blood.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_7_END_0,Almost done here. The central core is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_0,The central core contains the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_1,Protect our operator while she extracts the seed from their power production.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_2,Only one issue with this plan. The Avengers are guarding the area.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INTRO_3,All the more reason to move quickly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_START_0,Cover me while I extract the Ego Seed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_START_1,You dare defile Star-Lord's seed? Prepare to be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to the Ego Seed chamber's release mechanism.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_2_0,Fighting off security protocols.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_3_0,Beginning the extraction process. Almost there.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_FAIL_0,Abort. They've taken out our operator.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_8_END_0,I've got the Ego Seed secured. Let's get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_0,The good news is we've got the Ego Seed. The bad news is this dimension is already starting to collapse.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_1,How long until this place swallows itself up whole?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_2,You have approximately 2 hours to get back to the portal.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_INTRO_3,Time's a wasting!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_START_0,Pathetic cretins! Return the Ego Seed or die!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_START_1,"Yeah, give it back, you jerks! That's mine!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_0,"Fury, the team has returned with the Ego Seed. Mission accomplished."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_1,And what about the dimension itself?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_2,"Shortly after we closed the portal, we confirmed that no trace of it remains."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_3,Delete all records of this mission. It never happened. Are we clear?
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_4,"Understood. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_6_9_END_5,Good to see you're finally willing to do what needs to be done to win this War.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_0,"Commander, we have a crisis on our hands."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_1,"After creating our own dimensional portal, Director Fury was captured by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_2,We think we've found a lead on his location: a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in Colorado.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_INTRO_3,"If we take a full team out there, we might be able to rescue him before he is converted."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_START_0,Fury is somewhere in this facility.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_END_0,"Fury is being held on that Kree warship. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_1_END_1,Now we just need to find a way on board.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_0,We need to get onto that Kree warship and rescue Fury before they convert him.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_1,Any suggestions?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_2,"I say we charge in, guns blazing. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_3,I like the way this guy thinks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_INTRO_4,Shocker.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_START_0,I bet I can punch that guy farther than you can.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_START_1,Challenge accepted.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_2_END_0,Fury should be up ahead. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_0,If we are NOT able to rescue Nick Fury in time...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_1,Who will become the leader of S.T.R.I.K.E.?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_2,Let me guess: You think it should be YOU.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_3,I am clearly the most qualified at leading an army of highly trained--
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_INTRO_4,"Not going to happen, Turnip Head."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_START_0,We should be close to Fury's location.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_3_END_0,We need to move quickly if we're going to save Fury before the conversion is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INTRO_0,Director Fury is being held in the conversion chamber up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INTRO_1,Stop their operators from completing the process. We need to free him from the device!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_START_0,Take out their operators so we can get Director Fury out of there!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We need to stop them.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Fury is finished."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_3_0,We must take out the operators. We're running out of time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_INFO_DONE_0,Director Fury is free! Let's get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_FAIL_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_1_0,They've started the conversion process. We must hurry!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_2_0,"If we don't take out those operators, Fury will not survive."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_4_STOP_DONE_0,We're too late. The process is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_0,Launching a rescue mission on my behalf was irresponsible and reckless.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_1,You could have gotten the whole team killed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_2,You're welcome?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_3,We're getting reports of Kree capital ships appearing over every major city in the world.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_4,"Ultimus's full-scale invasion has begun. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_5,We need to secure New York City. Deploy the team.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_6,"Will do. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_7,"Oh, and Natasha..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_8,...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_INTRO_9,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_0,Doesn't it seem like we're saving New York City every other week?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_1,"Usually I'm trying to blow it up. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_5_START_2,This is uncharted territory for me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_0,A bunch of corrupted Groots was just sighted in Midtown.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_1,You mean a Grove?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_2,"No. Groots. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_3,"A Grove. Multiple Groots. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_4,A Grove of Groots.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_INTRO_5,This is why I work alone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_START_0,I am GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_6_START_1,You think fighting these things is bad for the environment?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_0,"Commander, distress call coming in from Russia."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_1,A force of invading Kree and corrupted heroes has sabotaged a power plant in Kamchatka.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_INTRO_2,We need to take out their operators before they can detonate the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_START_0,Intel suggests this Geothermal power plant is critical to the population.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_START_1,We need to take out their operators first.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_1_0,They're setting up explosive charges. We need to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_2_0,Hurry up and take out their operators...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_3_0,Time is running out. We must take out the operators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_STOP_DONE_0,We're too late. They're about the set off the charges! Clear the area!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_OP_DONE_0,We've taken care of the operators. Now to clean up the house...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_7_END_0,Area secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_0,The Commander is sending us to Iceland to stop a corrupted Thor.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_1,How are we gonna do that? Isn't he literally a GOD?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_2,"Remember, Ultimus's corrupted versions are weaker than our versions. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_3,This Thor is a demi-god at best.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_INTRO_4,"Oh, well now I'm only demi-freaked out. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_START_0,"Pitiful mortals, submit to Ultimus and you may be spared."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_END_0,That wasn't soooo bad.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_8_END_1,"Don't get cocky, kid."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_INTRO_0,A corrupted Ultron army is approaching Wakanda.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_INTRO_1,A S.T.R.I.K.E. team is on its way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_START_0,We claim this territory in Ultimus's name.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_0,"We're barely holding it together. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_1,"We need to come up with a plan soon, or the whole planet will fall."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_1_9_END_2,I think I have one. Call the S.T.R.I.K.E. teams back to base.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_0,There is only one way we will be able to stop Ultimus's invasion.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_1,"We take down one of his capital ships. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_2,That would send a message that this Earth is capable of fighting back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_3,Intel has pinpointed the location of a Kree transport in New York City.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_4,Sneak your way onto it and take down the capital ship above the city.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_INTRO_5,We're on it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_START_0,There's the transport. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_1_START_1,I'll draw their attention. You pick 'em off.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_0,Now we need to sabotage that Kree warship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_1,Aliens. Portal. The whole thing still seems weird to me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_2,And yet you have no issues taking orders from a talking teddy bear.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_3,"The Raccoon is okay in my book. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_INTRO_4,He augmented my mag clips so they shoot twice as much ammo.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_2_START_0,We'll need to blast our way through these guards.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_0,"Hey Elektra, now that we're on the same team..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_1,I'm assuming that means you've forgiven me for all that past stuff?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_2,You mean all the times you tried to kill me?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_3,And the one time you succeeded?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_INTRO_4,"No. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_3_START_0,"If you will not join Ultimus, you will die."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_0,There are S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra prisoners on this ship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_1,We should free them before they are corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_2,No time for that. We need to set the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_3,We're not leaving them here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_4,"Interesting. Is this one of those classic moral dilemmas you heroes are always struggling with? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_INTRO_5,"No. This is what we call a ""no-brainer"" in Hero-Speak."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_START_0,"Thanks for saving us. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_4_END_0,Head to the Kree transport ship. Get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_0,"Hey look, this blue alien has a mohawk."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_1,It's actually a headpiece that allows me to control my Yaka Arrow.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_2,Your Yucky what?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_INTRO_3,The thing I'm going to use to kill you.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_5_START_0,Whistle while you work...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_0,I call dibs on setting the charges on the reactor!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_1,You're volunteering to handle the volatile explosives?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_2,Be my guest.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INTRO_3,YES!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_START_0,Protect the operator. We need to place charges on the reactor!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_1_0,First set of charges placed. Three more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_2_0,Second set of charges placed. Two more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_3_0,Third set of charges placed. One more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_INFO_DONE_0,Charges are planted and armed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_FAIL_0,Our operator is down... Abort!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_6_END_0,Charges are planted and armed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_INTRO_0,Now we just need to fight our way out before this whole ship explodes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_INTRO_1,This is my favorite part.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_START_0,Umm... can I see your ticket?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_7_END_0,Into the Quinjet! Let's go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_INTRO_0,We need to keep up the pressure. Destroy the interdimensional portal above Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_INTRO_1,"If it involves blowing up more stuff, I'm in!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_0,"Hell's Kitchen again, huh? Glad there's no portal in Harlem."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_1,Sounds like the Kree are smart enough to not take the fight to your back door.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_START_2,Nice to see Harlem catch a break for once.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_END_0,"Affirmative, Director. We have eyes on a Class Five dimensional breach in Hell's Kitchen."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_8_END_1,"Shut it down, soldier. A demolitions team is en route."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_0,Cover the demolitions team while they plant the charges on the portal in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_1,"If this works, we'll be able to task S.T.R.I.K.E. with destroying all the portals around the globe."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_INTRO_2,You got it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_START_0,Demo team on-site. Cover us while we place the charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_2_9_END_0,"Breach is closed, Director."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_0,How is Ultimus able to maintain portals big enough to move entire Kree warships through them?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_1,"To move fleets of that size, he's got to establish a portal in BOTH dimensions in the same place."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_2,Wouldn't that mean that if we destroyed the portal on this side...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_3,It should make the portal unstable enough to shut down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_INTRO_4,"Send a team to Australia to shut down the first fleet portal. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_START_0,"A corrupted Captain America is leading this team. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_START_1,Stay frosty.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_CAP_0,Hail Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_0,Captain America fighting alongside Hydra?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_1,That just seems WRONG.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_2,We have the same situation on our side.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_3,"Yeah, but that's different. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_1_END_4,"It's not like he's running around saying ""Hail Hydra"" or anything."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INTRO_0,It appears that Hydra forces are being led by a corrupted Punisher.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INTRO_1,"Tread lightly, as there are also reports of elevated Gamma radiation levels in the area."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_START_0,Hulk Smash!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_START_1,Cover me while I place the charges on the dimensional portal!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_1_0,Initial set of charges placed. 3 more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_2_0,Second set of charges placed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_3_0,Third set of charges placed. 1 more to go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_INFO_DONE_0,Final set of charges placed. Evac outside the blast radius!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_FAIL_0,Our operator has been taken out. Abort!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_PUNISHER_0,I've decided to overcome my fear of the real Punisher...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_PUNISHER_1,By beating up this corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_2_END_0,That was oddly therapeutic.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_0,You ever think maybe Nick Fury is not the REAL Nick Fury?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_1,What are you babbling about now?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_2,In all the old shows I've seen from your generation...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_3,"...the bad guy from the alternate dimension always has an eye patch, scar, and goatee."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_4,So?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_5,Sound like a description of anyone we know?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_6,"What if OUR Nick Fury is the evil one, and the real one has two eyes, no scar, and is clean-shaven..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_INTRO_7,Not sure how much more of this kid I can take.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_START_0,We need to take down those A.I.M. Operatives. Fast.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_3_END_0,Area is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_INTRO_0,We have confirmation that a corrupted Red Skull is controlling the portal.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_INTRO_1,"Destroy the portal, and take him out along with his horde of Winter Soldiers."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_START_0,"Just like Hydra, when you strike down one Red Skull--"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_START_1,"Two more will take its place. For Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_FAIL_0,We need to fall back. Our operator has been taken out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_4_END_0,Charges have been placed. Area is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_0,Buenos Aires has a Fleet portal being controlled by corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_1,There's a lot of seismic activity in the area...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_2,...and tons of aftershocks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_3,You think they might have corrupted Quakes down there?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_INTRO_4,"Sure. That, too."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_START_0,You ready to rumble?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_END_0,"Area secure. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_5_END_1,On to the portal itself.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_INTRO_0,Now we just need to outfox all these Quakes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_INTRO_1,And set the charges on the portal to go BOOM.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_START_0,Cover me while I place the charges!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_FAIL_0,"Team, you lost your operator. Fall back."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_6_END_0,Charges placed. Clear the area!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_0,The final Fleet portal has been detected somewhere in the Himalayas.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_1,Make your way through the mountains and find the portal before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_2,We should think about custom S.T.R.I.K.E. jackets and stuff.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_3,My suit wasn't really designed for freezing cold weather.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_4,Put it in the suggestion box.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_5,There's a suggestion box?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_INTRO_6,No.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_START_0,The ground will run red with your blood by the end of this battle.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_END_0,I'm picking up readings of a portal in that ancient structure ahead. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_7_END_1,"Sure, we'll just stand around here until the next horde of ninjas sneaks up on us."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_0,Running low on ammo.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_1,Here you go. I got ammo coming out my butt.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_3,Not literally! You literally thought I had ammunition coming out of my butt?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_INTRO_4,"I'm talking to an alien raccoon with a jet pack. Nothing fazes me anymore. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_START_0,Ultimus is the only true master. I will destroy you in his honor.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_END_0,"You know, for a talking raccoon, you're not so bad."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_8_END_1,"You know, for a talking human, neither are you."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_0,If we can shut down this last Fleet portal...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_1,"...it will cut off Ultimus's ability to move in giant fleets of Kree warships. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_INTRO_2,Already prepping the explosives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_START_0,Cover me while I set the charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_END_0,All of the Fleet portals around the globe have been closed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_3_9_FAIL_0,Our operator has been taken out. Fall back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_0,"Danny, Ultimus's forces have been sighted around the mystical entrance to K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_1,Ultimus must not be allowed to enter the city.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_2,How did he find the entrance?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_3,"You're asking the wrong question, Mister Rand. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_4,The real question is...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_INTRO_5,What does he want with K'un-Lun?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_START_0,"After we defeat these forces, I can re-seal the entrance to K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_SISTERS_0,I'm going to enjoy this...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_1_END_0,Now we need to close the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INTRO_0,I must seal the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INTRO_1,Then we can figure out what Ultimus's purpose is here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_START_0,Protect me while I close the entrance to K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_3_0,Third barrier completed. 1 more remains...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_FAIL_0,We cannot complete the seal without Iron Fist. All is lost.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_0,K'un-Lun is safe. For now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_1,"Yes, but Ultimus's forces were able to steal a valuable artifact from K'un-Lun."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_2,The Wand of Watoomb was under their care. Now Ultimus has it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_3,What does Ultimus want with the wand?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_2_END_4,I don't know. But it cannot be good.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_0,"Mr. Rand, thank you for coming to Wakanda."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_1,Ultimus's forces came in the dead of night and stole the artifact we were charged to protect.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_2,"They stole the Ka Stone? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_3,"Yes. But we might be able to catch them before they escape. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_INTRO_4,There's no time to waste.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_START_0,Ultimus's forces are trying to escape with the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_START_1,Protect me while I close the portal.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_FAIL_0,"Team, we lost Iron Fist. We cannot close the portal without him."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_0,"I closed the portal, but the Ka Stone was not with them."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_1,"Ultimus has the stone now. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_2,"Yes. He is acquiring a specific set of powerful, mystical artifacts. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_3,What is the connection?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_3_END_4,I'm not sure. I need to consult the ancient texts.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_0,I would not summon S.T.R.I.K.E. unless the situation was dire.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_1,"As the former leader of the Hand for centuries, I would expect not."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_2,Since Ultimus replaced me with a brainwashed imposter...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_3,...only a few of my minions follow me still.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_4,"When Ultimus took control of the Hand, he also took control of an artifact of great power."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_5,The Siege Perilous. We must get it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_6,What does he need the artifact for?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_7,He said it was a key he needed for his ultimate goal. But he did not say more.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_INTRO_8,Then let's go get it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_START_0,Proceed with caution. Our enemies are strong.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_PANTHER_0,You're too late. No one can stop Ultimus now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_0,The Siege Perilous is gone.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_1,But they used the artifact to open a gateway to a nether realm.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_4_END_2,"We must close it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INTRO_0,"Nobu, you must close the gateway before the demonic forces are freed."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INTRO_1,"Protect me, and it will be done."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_START_0,Defend Nobu while he closes the gateway.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_3_0,Third barrier completed. 1 more remains...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_FAIL_0,Nobu has fallen. We have failed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_IRONMAN_0,Been wanting to test out my new weapons systems.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_0,The gateway is sealed. But Ultimus still has the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_1,"That makes three powerful artifacts under his control. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_5_END_2,We must discover why he is seeking these artifacts and stop him before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_0,"Daredevil, we need your help."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_1,Ultimus's forces are attacking the Sanctum Sanctorum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_2,They must not be allowed to break through.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_INTRO_3,They won't.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_START_0,We must defend the Sanctum from Ultimus's onslaught.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_0,Can we make this quick?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_1,"I'm rarely back on Earth, let alone New York City..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_STARLORD_2,...and I scored Hamilton tickets for after this fight.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_0,"That seemed a bit too easy, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_1,It was a diversion. A corrupted Mordo infiltrated the Sanctum during the fight.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_2,He stole an ancient spellbook. The Darkhold.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_3,"And lowered all the magical barriers protecting the Sanctum itself. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_6_END_4,We are completely exposed.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_INTRO_0,I need you to defend Iron Fist while he re-establishes the mystical barriers protecting the Sanctum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_INTRO_1,"I've got his back, sorcerer. Time to get to work."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_START_0,Provide protection while I re-establish the barriers around the Sanctum Sanctorum.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_FAIL_0,Iron Fist has fallen. Everyone fall back!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_GROOT_0,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_0,"The magical barriers are complete. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_1,"The Sanctum Sanctorum is protected again. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_2,But Ultimus still got that book.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_7_END_3,And we still don't know what he is planning to do with it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_0,"Thor Odinson, I think I know what Ultimus is planning. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_1,And I fear it will mean the end of this war.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_2,"If my theory is correct, he will be coming for a powerful artifact under your possession."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_3,The Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_4,How did you know?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_5,"Because, wizard, a corrupted version of my brother Loki absconded with the item yesterday. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_6,Do you know where they went?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_INTRO_7,I do.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_START_0,You will not leave this battlefield with the Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_DRAX_0,I will chop all of you into equally small pieces!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_END_0,They tricked us. The Warlock's Eye was never here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_8_END_1,And more foes will be unleashed by this gateway.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INTRO_0,"Thor, you must close the path to Asgard."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INTRO_1,It will be done. But it will take all my focus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_START_0,I will be vulnerable while I seal the gateway. I will need your assistance.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_1_0,First barrier established. 3 remain.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_2_0,Second barrier in place.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_3_0,Third barrier completed. 1 more remains...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_INFO_DONE_0,"Final barrier has been established. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_FAIL_0,We have failed...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_THOR_0,Fools. None can withstand Ultimus's might.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_ULTRON_0,Prepare for extermination.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_0,Ultimus now possesses the five artifacts he needs.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_1,What does he plan to do with them?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_2,"If I'm right, those artifacts are the keys to unlock a place of great power."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_3,The Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_4,"From there he can conquer all realities. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_4_9_END_5,He will be unstoppable.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E.'s received communication from the Fallen Dimension's ""smart"" Hulk."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_1,"Their Banner stabilized the vaccine that prevents Ultimus's conversion process. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_2,We have to manufacture the vaccine and administer it to every member of S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_3,"A.I.M. has the perfect facility, but it is under Ultimus's control. I will be glad to reacquire it for the cause. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_4,This mission is critical. I'm sending Iron Man as your backup.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_5,"Pleasure to be working with you again, Your Supreme-ness."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_6,"Let's keep things professional this time, Mr. Stark."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_INTRO_7,"Aww, where's the fun in that?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_START_0,"We are at the facility. Clear the way, would you, Mr. Stark?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_END_0,"The path is clear, Supreme Lady."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_1_END_1,Please stop that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_0,"Isn't it a little presumptuous to say you are the most ""supreme"" in all the sciences?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_1,I never claimed that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_2,It's literally your name!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_3,"And you refer to yourself as Iron Man, yet you barely qualify."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_4,"It's true. My suit contains very little iron. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_INTRO_5,That wasn't the part I was referring to.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_START_0,We need to take out these experiments while protecting Scientist Supreme!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>SCIENTIST SUPREME</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_END_0,"Adequate work, Mr. Stark. I'll be sure to forward you the charges to repair my suit."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_2_FAIL_0,Fall back! We need a medic at my position! NOW!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_0,"Ah, breathe in those chemicals! Well, on second thought, don't. They're highly toxic."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_1,"Supreme One, I am ready to begin the production of the vaccine."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INTRO_2,"Excellent. Let's begin, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_START_0,We need to defend Scientist Supreme's assistant from enemy forces as she works on the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_END_0,"The vaccine is complete. Prepare for inoculation. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_FAIL_0,Abort the mission! We can't use the A.I.M. lab now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_1_0,Booting up the manufacturing machines.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_2_0,Setting up vaccine manufacturing parameters.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_3_INFO_DONE_0,"The vaccine is complete. Prepare for inoculation. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_0,All VIPs and S.T.R.I.K.E. members have been given the vaccine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_1,"Director Fury, you are the last one we need to inoculate."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_2,Make it quick.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_3,Ultimus's forces are trying to take back the facility.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_INTRO_4,Looks like my checkup will have to wait.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_0,Can't let the Director fall into enemy hands! Keep them at bay!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>SCIENTIST SUPREME</color> AND <color=#fff568>NICK FURY</color>.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_END_0,"The inoculation is complete. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_4_FAIL_0,Director Fury and Scientist Supreme are down! We need evac! Now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_0,"Sir, a portal from the Fallen Dimension has opened in Midtown. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_1,I thought we took care of all those?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_2,"Apparently not. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_INTRO_3,Send a team.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_START_0,Whoever created this portal opened a floodgate. Take them out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_0,My apologies. I had to open a portal to your dimension to bring over my latest discovery.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_1,"No problem, Doctor Banner hyphen Hulk. Just try not to invite party crashers next time."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_2,I think I might have found a way to actually REVERSE the effects of Ultimus's Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_3,What's the catch?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_5_END_4,We have to find the Conversion Engine and gain access to it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_0,"We need to find the Conversion Engine in this dimension and gain access to it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_1,This dimension? There are multiple Conversion Engines?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_INTRO_2,There's a unique one built in each dimension. We need to triangulate its location to get the information I need to reverse its effects.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_START_0,The devices are set. Trying to locate the warship where the Conversion Engine is will draw out Ultimus's forces. Be ready.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_6_END_0,I have the location of the Conversion Warship.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_0,"Now that we know where Ultimus is housing his Conversion Engine in this dimension, we can plan our attack."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_1,Already on it. S.T.R.I.K.E. team on the way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_2,Without a plan? I was hoping the Tony Stark in this dimension was not quite as rash.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_INTRO_3,Don't know what I was thinking.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_START_0,Ronan and Korath are defending the Conversion Engine. Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_0,Now we just need to acquire the data from the Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_1,And escape with our lives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_7_END_2,"That, too."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_0,We must protect the operator while we access the data from the Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_1,Should be fine. Nothing Ultimus has thrown at us has stopped us yet.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_2,The Conversion Engine is usually guarded by Ultimus's Hulk Squad.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_INTRO_3,Oh great.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_START_0,We must protect the operator until the download is complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_END_0,We've completed the download. Evacuate.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_8_FAIL_0,We lost contact with the team. It's over.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INTRO_1,"Easy for you to say, Fury! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INTRO_2,You don't have half of the Kree army on your tail!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_START_0,Defend the operator until the pod arrives.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_START_1,PROTECT YOUR <color=#fff568>OPERATOR</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_END_0,Did you get the data you needed to work on reversing the effects of the Conversion Engine?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_END_1,I think so. I will keep you updated on my progress.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_FAIL_0,We lost the signal. It's too late.

ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_5_9_INFO_DONE_0,Pod has arrived. Let's move!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_0,"Commander of S.T.R.I.K.E., this is your final warning."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_1,Reveal the location of the Nexus of All Realities to me and surrender your forces...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_2,"Or I will decimate the populations of Earth's major cities. One at a time. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_3,You had your opportunity to join me...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_4,Now you only have one choice:
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_5,Obey or die.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_6,"Strange, what is Ultimus talking about?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_7,The entrance to the Nexus is somewhere on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_8,"Ultimus has the 5 keys he needs to open the path. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_9,"But he doesn't know where the entrance is. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_10,"But we do, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_11,"Working on it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_12,"Commander, picking up a large enemy force headed towards the Helicarrier."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_INTRO_13,Everyone get to the deck!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_START_0,"You should have listened to Ultimus while you still had the chance. Boys, rip this place apart."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_1_END_0,We can't hold them off! We have to get everyone off the Helicarrier now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_0,Ultimus is bombarding us from all directions here in Spain. I'm not sure how long we can hold out.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_1,We can't. Time to evacuate. Take a Quinjet and get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_2,"Stark, I hate it when you're right, but not much of a choice at this point. Save as many as you can."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_INTRO_3,Roger that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_0,"Clint, grab a Quinjet and let me know when you can get these folks out of here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_1,On it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_START_2,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_FAIL_0,I couldn't save them...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_2_END_0,"Tony, Quinjet incoming. Let's get out of here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_0,"Alright, we're clear. But I'm getting chatter about an attack at a crisis summit in Rome."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_1,Sounds like corrupted Hydra forces are threatening to blow the place sky high.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INTRO_2,I'll reroute S.T.R.I.K.E. resources over there. We have to save those world leaders.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_START_0,We have a message from Ultimus. The world will pay as long as S.T.R.I.K.E. resists!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_START_1,We need to take out those operators before they set those charges.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_1_0,They are priming the detonators.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_2_0,They're disabling kill switches.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_3_0,We need to stop them. We are running out of time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_FAIL_0,They're setting off the explosives. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_3_END_0,Bomb is secured.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus's Hand and A.I.M. forces are invading Rio de Janeiro.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_1,We need to help evacuate civilians in the area to prevent them from being enslaved by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_INTRO_2,"Just point me in the right direction. I'm gettin' good at saving humans.  "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_0,"Check this out, boy. Time to show you how a real arrow works."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_1,"Whistling? Really? Cheat if you have to, but all I need is a bow. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_START_2,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_FAIL_0,Dang it. We couldn't save those folks.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_4_END_0,"Alright, you've got some serious skills with that stick and string. Let's call it a draw."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_0,Ultimus's forces are hunting us down. We need to go underground.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_1,"Natasha, take your team and go dark. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_2,Get past Ultimus's patrols and regroup at the rendezvous.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_3,What about the forces invading the cities around the world?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_4,We're no good to them if we get captured. You taught me that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_5,"But without us defending them, millions will be corrupted."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_6,"We have to assume all of Earth is under Ultimus's control now. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_INTRO_7,We need to come up with a plan to take it back.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_START_0,This will be your last stand here and now. You should feel honored to die by my hand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_END_0,Ultimus's reinforcements are inbound. We can't hold them off for long.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_5_END_1,Into the tunnels. Go now!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_INTRO_0,"Ok, I think we can take a breather here."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_INTRO_1,"Scratch that idea, here they come. Get ready for a fight."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_START_0,You are surrounded and have nowhere to escape. Surrender to Ultimus now or die.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_START_1,Not much of a choice. Sounds like it's time to make a last stand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_6_END_0,That's the last of them. Time to regroup. Back to the Quinjet!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_0,"Natasha, got any good news for us?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_1,Not even a little. The entire United States has been overrun by Ultimus's forces.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_2,The United States? That's the town Peter's from. Is it an important Earth city?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_3,Some people think so.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_4,We need a new plan. We can't keep running forever.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_INTRO_5,Then let's make a stand.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_START_0,This area belongs to Ultimus. Give up now while you still have your breath.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_END_0,"I think I know a way we can innoculate the area from Ultimus's corruption. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_7_END_1,But we need to get ahold of Captain America.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_0,"Cap, did you secure the crate of the corruption vaccine?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_1,Sure did. We're ready to administer it to the general population. What's the plan?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_2,"Bruce, corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. forces have taken control of the Hoover Dam."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_3,Cover me while I release the vaccine into the water supply. This will protect millions of people.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INTRO_4,You can count on us.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_START_0,Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_1_0,Bringing dam control systems online.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_2_0,Opening valves for vaccine channels.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_3_0,Activating pumps for vaccine channels.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_FAIL_0,They took out Natasha. We need to regroup.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_8_END_0,The vaccine is in the water supply. Millions of people will be innoculated from Ultimus's corruption.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_0,"Fury, Ultimus has taken control of most of the planet."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_1,S.T.R.I.K.E. teams are being systematically hunted down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_2,"Strange, are we any closer to finding the entrance to the Nexus of All Realities?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_3,"Getting closer. But the good news is that Ultimus has not found it yet, either."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_4,"It's clear we're not going to win this war without help. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_5,Any chance you have found new allies in alternate dimensions yet?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_6,"Not yet, but it's possible."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_7,"There is a S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance force fighting a dimension controlled by Hydra, along with a dimension ruled by God King Thor."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_8,They might come to our aid.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_INTRO_9,Ultimus's forces have found us again. Time to scramble.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_START_0,"After we take out these forces, we need to fall back to the next hideout."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_0,"Fury, I've found the location to the Nexus of All Realities."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_1,Great. Now what do we do with it?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_2,We lead Ultimus to it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_3,Don't think I heard you right. Isn't that what we've been trying to avoid?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_4,It was. But getting Ultimus to go through the portal into the Nexus...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_6_9_END_5,Might be the only chance we have left to defeat him.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_0,Ultimus has established control in every major region across the world.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_1,"If he finds the gateway to the Nexus of All Realities, he will be unstoppable."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_2,Why is this Nexus thing so important again?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_3,"If Ultimus gets inside the Nexus of All Realities, he will have access to every dimension as well as control of all space and time."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_4,"Ah, right. That."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_5,We need to take out his leaders in every region to slow him down.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_6,"Let's start with the corrupted Elektra in her African compound. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_7,I guess it WOULD be too obvious to have an evil Black Panther ruling the region in our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_8,Any word from our mystical interdimensional recruiter?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_9,Doctor Strange has made contact with a dimension ruled by an all-powerful version of Vision.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_10,He has agreed to help us take down Ultimus's leaders.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_11,"Hold up, do I have to take orders from some Lawnmower Man version of my former assistant? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_12,NOT okay with that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_13,"We're working alongside our allies, Stark. Not for them."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_INTRO_14,"Just be sure to limit its security clearance. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_0,"Just to be clear, I'm in charge of this operation, Jarvis... Vision... Jarv-Vis."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_1,I have transcended beyond the need to exert my dominance over others merely to satiate my ego.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_2,I think you just agreed and insulted me at the same time.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_3,Very observant.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_START_4,THIS <color=#fff568>PUNISHER</color> USES HIS ULTIMATE ATTACK EVERY TURN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_END_0,I have confirmation that Elektra is on her Helicarrier up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_1_END_1,We must eliminate her before she can escape.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_0,"Vision, we need to take back this Helicarrier and take down Elektra."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_1,Follow my lead.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_2,I believe you are mistaking me with the subservient version of myself from your dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_3,The Vision I know isn't subservient. He's selfless.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_4,"Records indicate that he defers to your plans, even though he knows they are flawed. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_5,"Yeah, it's called trust. \nIt goes both ways."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_INTRO_6,"Or faith... so very human. \nVery well, then. After you."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_0,I have sworn to protect this territory for Ultimus with my life.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_1,"I admit it, I'm a little jealous of Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_START_2,I can't even get my assistant to get my coffee order right.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_2_END_0,Having this Helicarrier will give us a fighting chance. Four more targets to go.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_0,"Corrupted Kingpin is running operations for Ultimus in Hong Kong. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_1,We need to remove him from power to establish a foothold in the region.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_2,"Fury needs my help with some top secret S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_3,You ready to take off the training wheels and do this one without me?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_4,I govern and maintain the lives of over 9 trillion beings in my dimension.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_INTRO_5,Just checking. Don't blow a gasket.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_START_0,Glad you're here. Been hoping to take my aggression out on some heroes.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_3_END_0,Corrupted Kingpin is up ahead. We must disrupt his operations before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_0,"Hey Vision, you've got, like, major superior intelligence, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_1,"By human standards, my Intelligence Quotient is quite high."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_2,So then you MUST know what S.T.R.I.K.E. stands for.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_INTRO_3,Of course I do. \nIt's in the training manual.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_START_0,I am in charge of this territory. You will not be taking away what I have earned.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_4_END_0,Kingpin has been removed. On to the next territory.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_0,My forces have driven the corrupted Kingpin out of Hong Kong.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_1,I will take care of Baron Mordo. \nHe has established a base in Transylvania.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_2,You mean Romania.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_3,I prefer to reference locations by their mystical names.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_INTRO_4,I know a mystical place where you can take that attitude.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_0,Can't you just magic us to the back of the castle where Mordo is?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_1,No. Mordo has set up magical barriers everywhere.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_2,We'll have to fight through to him the old-fashioned way.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_START_3,Figures.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_0,That's the last of them. Mordo's study is at the back of his castle.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_1,"Does he keep his coffin back there, too? Away from any direct sunlight and wreaths of garlic?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_5_END_2,"Also, wasn't this Count Dracula's castle? Which one is higher rank... Count or Baron?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_0,Beware. \nMordo's power rivals my own.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_1,"Baron definitely outranks Doctor. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_2,"Careful, Stark. Don't make me turn you back into a rat and erase your memory again."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_INTRO_3,Wait. What?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_START_0,Heathens! Ultimus demands your blood...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_START_1,"See! I told you, Strange. This guy thinks he's a vampire."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_6_END_0,"Mordo is vanquished. Three down, two to go. The Inner Circle is starting to crumble."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_0,Time to bring the fight to Washington D.C. to begin coordinated attacks on Ultimus there.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_1,Corrupted Hydra and Ultron forces have been entrenched there for weeks now.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_INTRO_2,It's about time we pushed them out of there for good.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_START_0,This land is under the control of Ultimus's Hydra forces. Prepare for your end.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_START_1,I have had it with all these snakes on this dimensional plane!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_7_END_0,"That's one less viper's nest to worry about. Now we take on Red Skull. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_0,"Once we take out this corrupted Red Skull, the U.S. will be free again."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_1,"You're starting to sound like a real patriot there, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_INTRO_2,Iron Patriot? Not really my thing.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_0,"After more than seventy years in exile on Vormir, Ultimus has honored me with this noble task."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_1,We have finally conquered the U.S. in the name of Hydra... and Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_2,You will not reclaim it.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_3,"Oh, this is going to feel good."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_START_4,THIS <color=#fff568>RED SKULL</color> CAN SUMMON EVERY OTHER TURN.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_8_END_0,"Hydra has been eliminated from Washington, time to find that last lieutenant before he goes into hiding."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_0,"Tony, I need you to take a team to Vancouver and take out Ultimus's last lieutenant."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_1,A corrupted Wolverine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_2,Great. That guy's claws will rip through my armor like a can opener.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_INTRO_3,"That's why you're taking a full squad. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_START_0,"Shouldn't have come, bub. Can't let you leave alive."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_START_1,THIS <color=#fff568>WOLVERINE</color> HAS A SUPERCHARGED HEALING FACTOR AND RESISTANCES.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_0,Overthrowing Ultimus's lieutenants ought to cripple his operations in the near term.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_1,And he still has yet to find the entrance to the Nexus of All Realities.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_2,But neither have we.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_3,We'll keep at it. Ancient texts haven't given us much to work with thus far.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_4,"The more allies we bring into this fight, the better our chances of keeping Ultimus from finding the gateway."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_5,"In the meantime, we need to find other ways to debilitate Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_6,Got anything new we can work with?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_7,"I've been studying the schematics we stole from Ultimus's Conversion Engine, and I think I found a way to exploit the device."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_8,The machine is attuned to bend the subject's will to Ultimus's.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_9,"You figure that out all by yourself, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_10,"ANY Ultimus, you idiot. Including the Ultimus from our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_11,"If we can get our Ultimus inside the Conversion Engine, we could switch the corrupted's control to OUR Ultimus's will."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_12,"I can't see how that plan could POSSIBLY go wrong. Oh wait, let me do the math again..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_13,"That's a terrible idea. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_7_9_END_14,"You have any better ideas, Stark?"
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_0,"What do you want, Kree hunter? The Kree Empire has pledged its loyalty to Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_1,We are now sworn enemies in this war.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_2,"I come in peace, Asgardian. I am part of a resistance movement within the Kree."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_3,Ultimus promised that the Kree would rule our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_4,"He did not mention it would be ruled under his iron fist. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_5,"Ultimus is mad with power. His first act as ruler was to destroy the Supreme Intelligence. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_6,Ronan the Accuser led a Kree rebellion until he was captured.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_7,"If we can free Ronan from Ultimus's prison before he is corrupted, the Kree Resistance will join with S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_INTRO_8,The Kree could be a valuable ally in the war. We will help you free Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_START_0,These corrupted will not stand between us and our goal.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_1_END_0,Ronan is being held near here. We must move quickly.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_0,Ultimus is keeping Ronan on this planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_1,An army of heathen Ravagers guards the area. Be wary.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_INTRO_2,We will strike them down where they stand.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_START_0,"Ravagers, fresh meat. Take 'em out."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_FAIL_0,They've taken out our allies. We must fall back.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_2_END_0,Now we just need to find out where Ronan is being held.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_0,"Ronan could be anywhere on this planet. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_1,My Kree tracker can pinpoint his location given enough time.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INTRO_2,Then time she shall have.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_START_0,"I can pinpoint Ronan's location with this device. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_1_0,Setting search parameters for Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_2_0,Triangulating Ronan's location to within 3 kilometers.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_3_0,Location now within a 500 meter radius.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator. Let's regroup.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_3_END_0,Ronan is being converted on a docked Kree Warship up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_INTRO_0,This warship is where Ronan is being held.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_INTRO_1,We must make haste and dispatch with the guards quickly.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_START_0,There's no way you're taking Ronan back from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_4_END_0,The Conversion Engine is just up ahead. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INTRO_0,Ronan is already in the conversion chamber. We must hurry.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INTRO_1,We will free your ally. Fear not.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_START_0,"So Korath found us already, huh? That guy is such a pain in the tail! Well, let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_1_0,They are starting the conversion process on Ronan.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_2_0,We must stop their operators before it is too late.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_3_0,We are running out of time. Stop the operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_FAIL_0,We're too late. Ronan is lost to us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_0,You were wise to come to my aid. Kree vengeance will be swift.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_1,We must gain access to the Supreme Intelligence. It will help us overthrow Ultimus and--
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_2,Ultimus has destroyed the Supreme Intelligence. You are the only free leader of the Kree left.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_5_END_3,"Then we must gather our forces quickly. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_0,Ultimus will pay for subverting the Kree Empire.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_1,I will purge the galaxy of this false idol and scatter his ashes to the solar winds.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_INTRO_2,THIS is why you are destined to be the next leader of the Kree Resistance.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_START_0,You have taken what belongs to Ultimus. Submit or die.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_6_END_0,Now we must find a way off this accursed planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_0,"My people will rally to my call. Ultimus must face judgment. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_1,"They need only learn the truth, and they will rise up in arms."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_2,This planet is home to a long-range communications transmitter.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_3,"Take the transmitter, and I will send the word of truth to every corner of the empire."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_4,It appears our plan must wait. I sense a growing storm on the horizon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_INTRO_5,"Ultimus has sent the Thors and Hulks of conquered dimensions to stop us. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_7_START_0,"You are not true Sons of Odin. You have betrayed Asgard, and you shall pay."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_0,The transmitter lies ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_1,"Crush these heretics, and I will broadcast the message to my people. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_2,"We will get you inside. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_3,But be prepared for a fight.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_INTRO_4,Ultimus has sent corrupted versions of you to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_START_0,You all stand accused of defying Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_8_START_1,And are all found GUILTY!
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_0,"We cannot hold back Ultimus's forces for long. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_1,"Ronan, send your message."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_2,We must align the array.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INTRO_3,Defend my operator while the signal is sent.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_START_0,Filthy Kree. It is my destiny to destroy you in Ultimus's name.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_START_1,Defend me while I broadcast Ronan's message.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_1_0,Starting up the signal enhancement generators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_2_0,Tracking down all Kree broadcast towers.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_3_0,Opening all Kree broadcast channels.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_FAIL_0,They've defeated our operator. We have failed.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_0,The message is sent. A call to arms to rise up against Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_1,The Kree Resistance will join S.T.R.I.K.E. in your war against this usurper.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_2,"With the liberated Kree at our side, we might turn the tide of this battle."
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_3,"True. We have just ignited a Kree civil war. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_4,Peace will not come until all Kree are united as one.
ID_DIALOG_COS_1_9_END_5,And that cannot happen until Ultimus falls.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_0,"Lo, Star-Lord. We must speak."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_1,We have located Ultimus's energy station that powers his massive portals.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_2,"It is on the planet Contraxia. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_3,"Contraxia? That ice ball is full of outlaws, Ravagers, and mercenaries."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_4,My kind of people.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_5,Which is why the Commander wishes us to lead a cosmic S.T.R.I.K.E. team to the planet...
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_6,And destroy the energy station.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_INTRO_7,"Thor, you had me at ""lo."""
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_START_0,Ravagers. Shocker. Let's light it up!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_1_END_0,The energy fortress should be up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_0,"Drax, we have to take out this patrol before they alert the entire base."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_1,Keep everything on the down-low.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_2,I do not keep anything DOWN or LOW. But I will swiftly vanquish these enemies.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INTRO_3,Why do I even bother?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_START_0,"We must take out their operators, or they will alert the entire fortress."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_1_0,They're alerting the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_2_0,We need to stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_3_0,We are running out of time. Stop their operators.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_FAIL_0,It's too late. We must retreat.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_2_END_0,Onward into the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_0,Defeating these guards is the only way to get into the station and destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_1,"Thank you, Captain Obvious."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_2,"You are welcome, Peter Quill."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_3,"But I am Drax, not Obvious. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_INTRO_4,And I am not a captain.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_START_0,For Asgard!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_3_END_0,The energy station control room is up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_0,Combing through the systems here. It looks like Ultimus has a Scientist Supreme running the show.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_INTRO_2,Totally. I would NOT want to be on her bad side.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_START_0,You fools. Did you not think I had calculated every possible way you might attempt to stop me?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_START_1,"Your calculations are no match for my Hammer, Scientist. Step aside, or feel my wrath."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_4_END_0,We must press on deeper into the fortress.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_0,It appears that Scientist Supreme has deployed Ultrons to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_1,These soulless automatons are no match for my blades.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_INTRO_2,"Well put, Drax the Destroyer. Attack!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_START_0,Uh... that's a lot of robots...
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_5_END_0,We must find access to the control room to destroy the weapon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_0,This corrupted Yondu holds the security key that will give us access to the engineering control room.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_1,Yondu loves me. Let me handle this.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_2,"Peter, every corrupted version of Yondu we encounter tries to kill you."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_INTRO_3,But only out of LOVE.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_0,"Big mistake showing up here, kid. I'm afraid we're going to have to kill y'all."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_1,"See, Gamora. He loves me!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>YONDU</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_6_END_0,Yondu is vanquished. Grab his key and press onward.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_0,You guys need to cover me while I set the explosives to blow this place sky high.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_1,We do not need to destroy this place to the sky. Only destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_2,"Just cover me, Drax."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INTRO_4,"Yeah, Groot. Maybe his mom DID drop him on his head as a baby."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_START_0,"Cover me, guys. I need all the time you can give me!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to the base's reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_2_0,Planting the worm to take control of the reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_3_0,Disabling all failsafe controls on the reactors.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_FAIL_0,I AM GROOT!!!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_7_END_0,We're all set. Time to get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_0,We must make haste and flee before the fortress explodes.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_1,"Let's go, people. You snooze, you lose."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_2,I do not intend to sleep nor admit defeat at a time like this.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_INTRO_3,"Just run, Drax. Just. Run."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_START_0,Stop them! Don't let them out of here alive!
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_8_END_0,"As expected, I did not sleep, and so I was victorious!"
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_INTRO_0,We must hurry. The fortress is about to explode.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_INTRO_1,"We're almost clear! Well, except for that massive force standing right in the path of our ship."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_START_0,You will never make it off this planet alive.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_0,Destroying Ultimus's energy station prevents him from transporting more troops into this dimension.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_1,Glad to help out.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_2,Now we must rally the Kree Resistance and take back their home planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_3,Oh yeah. Forgot about that.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_4,"Could we, like, do that tomorrow? This hero stuff is pretty exhausting."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_5,"There is no time to spare, Star-Lord. Every second we waste, Ultimus grows stronger."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_6,Fine. Better get to it then. But you owe me a drink when this is all done.
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_7,"If we survive, we shall share a drink of the finest Asgardian ale."
ID_DIALOG_COS_2_9_END_8,Now you're talking. Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_0,"Loki, you know I would not come to you unless the situation was dire."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_1,"Flattery will get you nowhere, brother."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_2,"We need your help infiltrating Hala, the Kree home world, and overthrowing Ultimus's forces there."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_3,Why me?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_4,"The task requires deception, stealth, and trickery. I know of no one better than you at these things. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_5,"You're going to make me blush. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_6,I'm in.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_7,"Really? Because I had prepared a grand speech about loyalty and ""doing the right thing"" and--"
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_8,"For you to be indebted to me is reward enough. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_INTRO_9,Follow me. I think I know a way for us to enter the planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_START_0,"If we take out the guards of this warship, I can disguise us as the crew."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_START_1,It should get us onto the Kree planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_1_END_0,Getting aboard is the easy part. Making it to Hala without being discovered is another matter.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_0,Convincing the Kree to rebel against Ultimus will not be easy.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_1,We have Ronan the Accuser leading the rebellion. He is well-respected among the Kree.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_2,Would be far easier for me to masquerade as their leader and lead the rebellion.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_INTRO_3,Let's worry about clearing out this section of the warship first. Global conquest through deception second.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_START_0,You will ALL become children of Ultimus soon.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_2_END_0,"The Kree home world approaches. If we secure the bridge of the ship, we should arrive safely."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_0,It seems Ultimus put a corrupted Spider-Man in charge of this ship.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_1,"Take him out, and I can appear as him to take control of the ship."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_2,Very well. Let's get this unsavory business over with.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_INTRO_3,"I'm actually quite enjoying this. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_START_0,Ultimus put me in charge of this ship. No way I'm handing it over to you guys.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>SPIDER-MAN</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_0,Now I simply don Spider-Man's likeness and...
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_1,...we land on the planet safely under Ultimus's flag.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_3_END_2,And none too soon. This deception makes my skin crawl.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_0,Ultimus has gathered the Kree who have rebelled against him in an internment camp.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_1,"If we free them before they are converted, the revolution will spill out into the streets of the capital."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_2,"Sowing chaos and confusion? You're starting to think like me, brother."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_INTRO_3,I like it!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_START_0,We must quickly take out the patrol guarding the internment camp.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_4_END_0,Easy work. Now to release the prisoners.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_0,The raccoon can access the security gates and release the prisoners remotely.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_1,"Only if you say ""please."""
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_2,And you let me wear your helmet when this is done.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_3,"What? No. Just do your job, vermin."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INTRO_4,Worth a shot.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_START_0,We must protect Rocket while he disables the prison security grid.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_1_0,Gaining access to security controls through back door channels.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_2_0,Replacing all security camera footage with empty loop footage.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_3_0,Disabling backup generators for security lockdown procedures.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_FAIL_0,They've taken out Rocket. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_END_0,Job's done! Now gimme that helmet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_5_END_1,No. And kindly release my leg.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_0,Now this is interesting. The director of this facility is none other than a corrupted version of myself!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_1,Blessed Odin! Does that mean I get to beat you up while you watch?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_2,"It's always been a dream of mine. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_3,Yes. There's that. But more importantly--
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_4,"After we replace him, I can use my DNA access to disable the planetary defense grid."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_INTRO_5,Ronan's invasion force can land on the planet undetected.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_0,Should have known that S.T.R.I.K.E. would send ME to try to usurp me.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_1,We are the most natural choice.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LOKI</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_0,That was glorious.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_1,I agree. Seeing Ronan's invasion fleet take the capital was impressive.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_2,I was speaking about the part where a corrupted version of you was pummeled into submission.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_3,Yes. That was particularly disturbing.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_6_END_4,"Glorious. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_0,"We have driven Ultimus's forces out of the capital. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_1,Now we must press the attack and drive the corrupted off the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_2,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_3,"We are indebted to you, Loki. But there is still a war to be won."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_4,Of course. But still...
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_INTRO_5,You're welcome.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_START_0,Ultimus is launching a counterattack with his Ultron forces.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_7_END_0,Drive them back. Soon they will have no choice but to flee the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_0,Ultimus's forces have fallen back to one last outpost.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_1,"We win this next fight, and Hala is ours."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_INTRO_2,"Then let us make haste. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_8_START_0,DEFENSE MODE INITIATED.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_0,The Kree home world is ours. Ultimus's forces have abandoned the planet.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_1,"Uh, guys? I'm picking up dark matter signatures coming from an outpost in the north."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_2,I thought we took out all of Ultimus's forces.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_3,"Guess we missed some. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_4,"If they detonate a dark matter bomb, it will take out the entire planet."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INTRO_5,Then what are we doing standing around here for?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_START_0,We must stop the operators before they detonate the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_1_0,We must hurry. They are arming the charges.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_2_0,There is no time to waste!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_3_0,They are nearly finished!
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_FAIL_0,The charges have been activated. They are about to detonate the--
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_0,The Kree Resistance control Hala once more. Safe from Ultimus the Usurper.
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_1,"And once again, you're welcome."
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_2,"Now we must find a way to drive Ultimus out of this dimension entirely. "
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_3,And THEN we party?
ID_DIALOG_COS_3_9_END_4,"Aye, Star-Lord. Then the revels commence."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_0,"Fury, I've discovered the true reason Ultimus needs our dimension so badly."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_1,Ours is the closest to a mystical plane known as--
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_2,"The Nexus of All Realities. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_3,"Once Ultimus gains access to it, he can conquer any dimension he chooses."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_4,He needs five ancient artifacts to unlock the path to the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_5,So we stop him from getting those artifacts.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_6,"Too late. He already has them. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_7,"Ultimus has the keys, but he hasn't found the door yet."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_8,The entrance to the Nexus of All Realities is somewhere on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_9,I'm still waiting for the good news.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_10,"I know a way to travel between dimensions without using Ultimus's portals. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_11,I can take a team of mystics to acquire versions of the artifacts from dimensions Ultimus has yet to invade.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_12,We might be able to get to the Nexus before Ultimus and prevent him from entering.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_INTRO_13,"Do what you have to, Strange. We have to stop Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_0,"The first artifact we need is known as the Ka Stone. I found a dimension where it exists. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_1,"Unfortunately, the dimension is ruled by the God of Deception, Loki."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_START_2,You trespass on the Trickster God's domain. Be prepared to feel Loki's wrath.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_1_END_0,We must fight our way to safety and then locate the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_0,Protect me while I search the astral plane for the location of the Ka Stone.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_1,This sort of power should never have fallen into the hands of a miscreant like Loki.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INTRO_2,"All the more reason for us to take it from him. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_START_0,You dare defile our Loki's sacred space. You will pay in blood.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_1_0,Beginning my search throughout this realm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_2_0,Location coming into focus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_3_0,I've almost got it. Hang on.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_FAIL_0,We cannot proceed without Strange. We must retreat.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_2_END_0,I have found the Ka Stone. Loki's palace is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_0,"Loki will have the Ka Stone in his possession. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_1,"Once we retrieve the Stone, we should use it to wipe out this entire dimension."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_INTRO_2,We take the Ka Stone and leave. We have disrupted the natural order of this dimension too much already.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_START_0,What do we have here?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_START_1,Rogues trying to steal my Ka Stone? \nI think not.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_3_END_0,"We have the Ka Stone. I will guide us to our next destination. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_0,"Prepare yourselves. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_1,"This next dimension is a lawless wasteland. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_2,The land is divided between the warlords Kingpin and Nobu.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_3,Which one has the Wand of Watoomb?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_4,We don't know for certain. Where would you prefer to begin?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_5,Beating up the Hand or beating up Kingpin?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_6,"That's like choosing between candy and chocolate. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_INTRO_7,"We'll start with Fisk. If he doesn't have it, you'll get your chance to defeat Nobu. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_START_0,This is the Kingpin's territory. Trespassers are shot on sight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_4_END_0,"Kingpin's stronghold should be up ahead. Hopefully he possesses the Wand. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INTRO_0,Kingpin is a natural born warlord. He will be well-protected.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INTRO_1,Who wants to bet the Wand of Watoomb is the key to his power?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_START_0,We have to act fast before they call for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_START_1,Kingpin pays triple for people with capes! Tag 'em and bag 'em.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_1_0,Take them down before they call in support!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_2_0,Hurry! They're calling for backup!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_3_0,It's now or never!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_FAIL_0,We're trapped! They've got us surrounded!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_5_END_0,Kingpin's penthouse is up ahead. Let's go pay him a visit.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_0,"Warlord Kingpin, huh? This should be interesting."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_1,He'll be more lethal than the Kingpin on our Earth. The Wand of Watoomb is exceptionally powerful.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_INTRO_2,We must keep our focus on him if we have any hope of defeating him and taking the object for ourselves.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_0,"Impressive that you made it this far. Unfortunately, this is the end of the road for you."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_1,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>KINGPIN</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_6_END_0,I have secured the Wand of Watoomb. On to the next dimension.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_0,"The next artifact is the ancient tome, the Darkhold."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_1,"That is quite dangerous. In the wrong hands, the Darkhold could wreak havoc."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_2,You have my support in seeking it out.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_3,"Thank you, T'Challa. I know where the Darkhold is, but..."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_4,"What is it, doctor? "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_5,It's in a dimension ruled by an evil Baron Mordo.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_6,"We have faced off several times, but this Mordo will be more powerful with the Darkhold."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_INTRO_7,Fear not. Together we will best him and take back the Darkhold.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_START_0,"Sorcery is forbidden without express consent from our supreme leader, Baron Mordo. Surrender or die."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_7_END_0,I've always found this dimension to be particularly oppressive. That's the handywork of Mordo for you.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INTRO_0,"In order to get anywhere near Mordo in this world, we have to first get past his elite bodyguards."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INTRO_1,They call themselves the Sisterhood. All women of exceptional fighting prowess.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_START_0,We must take out their operators before they seal off Mordo's throne room. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_START_1,You guys picked the wrong crew to mess with.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_1_0,The barrier ritual has begun.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_2_0,The ritual is growing in strength. Hurry up!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_3_0,They've almost got the barrier up!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_FAIL_0,They completed the spell. There's no way to reach Mordo now.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_8_END_0,Now only Mordo remains.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_0,Mordo is up ahead. Proceed with caution.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_1,He has the Darkhold in his possession. Expect a tough fight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_2,I welcome the challenge.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_INTRO_3,"If we take out Mordo, his power over the others will wane. Defeating him is the key."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_0,"Strange, you should not have come."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_1,"Just hand over the Darkhold and my stay will be extremely short, I assure you."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_2,<color=#fff568>BARON MORDO</color> HEALS AFTER EACH DEATH.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_START_3,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>BARON MORDO</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_0,We have acquired three of the five objects of power.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_1,Now we need to secure the Warlock's Eye and the Siege Perilous to open the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_2,I found a version of the Siege Perilous in a dimension that has been overrun by Hydra.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_1_9_END_3,An entire dimension ruled by Hydra? Sounds pleasant.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_0,The next mystical item we need to open the Nexus is the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_1,The closest dimension where it exists is ruled by Hydra.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_2,I'll lead a team of mystics to that dimension to retrieve the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_3,An entire dimension ruled by Hydra? Sounds like my worst nightmare.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_4,Worse than an interdimensional invasion of corrupted versions of ourselves?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_INTRO_5,You making me choose?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_0,We have him cornered. Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_1,"This dimension's Hawkeye needs our help. And we could use a guide. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_FAIL_0,Hawkeye is down!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_1_END_0,Thanks for the assist. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance is in your debt.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_0,"Hawkeye, I don't have time for lengthy exposition. Here's the situation:"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_1,We come from an alternate dimension. We're here to steal the Siege Perilous from Hydra. Can you help us?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_2,"Uh, nice to meet you, too."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_3,"That artifact you mentioned, the Siege Perilous, is the source of Red Skull's power in our world. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_4,"If you can get it from them, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance will have a shot at overthrowing Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_5,"Help me get past the Hydra patrols and back to our base, and I'll help you with your mission."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_INTRO_6,Just lead the way.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_START_0,We can't get around this patrol. Gotta put them down to move along.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_FAIL_0,Hawkeye is down! Now we'll never find the Resistance HQ.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_2_END_0,You guys have a knack for taking down Hydra. Nicely done.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_0,Do you guys have Hydra in your dimension?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_1,"Unfortunately, yes. ""If a head is cut off, two more shall take its place."""
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_2,I take it they don't rule your planet like they do here?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_3,"Not so much. But we've got our own problems. An unstoppable, multi-dimensional alien army recently invaded us."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_INTRO_4,"Frankly, that sounds like a lot more fun than what's going on here."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_0,"Hawkeye, nice to run into you here. Red Skull will be pleased to finally have your head."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_1,"If we take out Crossbones first, his platoon will scatter."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAWKEYE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>CROSSBONES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_FAIL_0,They took out Hawkeye! We have no way to find the Resistance HQ now.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_3_END_0,"Hawkeye, welcome back to HQ. Looks like you found some new friends along the way?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_0,"Director, this group saved my skin out there. We owe them. They come from another dimension and need our help."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_1,"The S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance is on its last leg. If we don't take down Red Skull soon, we'll never free the world from Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_2,"Perhaps we can help. We need to take the Siege Perilous from Red Skull. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_3,"We've been trying to get that artifact from Red Head for years. If you manage that, we could turn the tide."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INTRO_4,Director! Hydra troops have breached the perimeter! They've found us!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_0,"Natasha, you've been working for Hydra all along? How could you?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_1,Give up now. You cannot defeat Red Skull. Hydra is far too powerful.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_START_2,We have to take out the Hydra Operators before they can call in air support!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_1_0,They're calling for air support.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_2_0,We have to stop them!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_3_0,We're running out of time. Take out the operators!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_FAIL_0,We're finished. Their bombers will be here any minute!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_4_END_0,We need to bring the fight directly to Red Skull. I've got an idea...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_0,"Director Quake, what's the plan?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_1,There's a Hydra lab nearby that I hacked into. Red Skull's spymaster is scheduled to be there today.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_2,"If we can get inside and corner him, we can grab his access codes and use them to get into Red Skull's bunker."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_3,That lab has a bunch of civilian scientists working there. We need to protect them if we get into a firefight.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_INTRO_4,"Good call, Hawkeye."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_START_0,"Remember, we need to protect the civilians at all costs."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_START_1,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>CIVILIANS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_FAIL_0,They took out the civilians!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_5_END_0,Red Skull's spymaster is in the lab up ahead. Let's move!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_0,So who is this mysterious spymaster of Red Skull?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_1,"Well, he used to run S.H.I.E.L.D., but it turned out he was part of Hydra all along."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_2,You can't mean--
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_3,Nick Fury.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_4,Oh. I thought you were going to say someone else.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_5,"So you have Fury in your dimension, too? Is he a manipulative and deceptive mastermind or a good guy?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_INTRO_6,Yes. And yes.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_0,"Quake, surrender now before your people get hurt."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_1,"Fat chance, Fury. You betrayed your people and the cause. Today, we're putting you down for good."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>NICK FURY</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_6_END_0,Fury's down. I've got the access codes. Let's get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INTRO_0,"Captain, the Skull's Nest is just up ahead. Based on the blueprints, we can gain access here."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INTRO_1,"Good work, Hawkeye. We need to take out any Hydra patrols we encounter to avoid sounding the alarm."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_START_0,Hydra Operators are part of this patrol. Take them out quickly to avoid the alarm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_1_0,They're calling for reinforcements.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_2_0,If they sound the alarm we're done for.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_3_0,We can't let them sound the alarm!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_FAIL_0,We're too late. No way to Red Skull now. The fortress is on lockdown.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_7_END_0,Area is secured. Let's keep moving.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_0,Slight change of plans. I'm picking up chatter that Hydra has S.H.I.E.L.D. Resistance fighters up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_1,"If we can free them from their cells and get them into the fight, it'll increase our odds."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_INTRO_2,Sounds reasonable. We'll provide the cover you need.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_START_0,We need to free these S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoners.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_START_1,PROTECT THE <color=#fff568>S.H.I.E.L.D. RESISTANCE PRISONERS</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_FAIL_0,Our resistance fighters have been taken out. Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_8_END_0,Red Skull's subterreanean bunker is up ahead. Time to end this.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_INTRO_0,"If we defeat Red Skull, you can have the Siege Perilous for your world."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_INTRO_1,"Thank you, Captain. We won't let you down."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_0,"You cannot hope to defeat me. Hydra has, and will always, rule this world."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_1,Hail Hydra!!!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_START_2,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>RED SKULL</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_0,"With Red Skull gone, Hydra has lost its leader. Now we need to capitalize on the momentum."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_1,"We are forever in your debt. When you need us, we'll come to your aid."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_2,Glad to help.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_3,And here is the Siege Perilous.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_4,"What do you need this thing for, anyway?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_5,"It's a key. A key that opens a magical gate to another dimension, and maybe to victory."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_6,Good luck retaking the world. And keep an eye out for any interdimensional alien invaders.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_2_9_END_7,What was that about?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_0,I've located a dimension with the final artifact we need to open the portal to the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_1,You found the Warlock's Eye? We must go there immediately.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_2,And lay waste to any who stand in our way.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_3,"Not so fast, Mordo. This dimension is ruled by a benevolent God of Thunder, Thor."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_4,I don't care if it's ruled by the God of Adorable Puppies.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_5,"If it stands in the way of our goal, we must eliminate it."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_6,"If we treat every obstacle as a threat, we make enemies out of everyone. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_7,"We have to be better than that. We will negotiate with this God King Thor. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_INTRO_8,Perhaps we can even make an ally out of him in our war.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_START_0,"Halt! If you seek an audience with the God King, Thor Odinson, you must prove yourselves worthy."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_START_1,In combat.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_1_END_0,You have shown great spirit. Come! Let us speak...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_0,"Good King Thor, we are travelers from another dimension. We need to ""borrow"" an artifact, the Warlock's Eye, to stop a threat to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_1,"The Warlock's Eye? I cannot simply ""lend"" items of power to strangers from another land."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_2,Would it make any difference if I told you that this threat will eventually wipe out your dimension if we do not stop it in ours?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_3,"Possibly. You seem noble in your cause and manner. I will grant you your wish, wizard. On one condition..."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_4,"You must complete the Three Trials of Asgard. If you do, I will grant you the Warlock's Eye."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_5,Trials? Really? Fine. Let's get this over with.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_INTRO_6,"I like your confidence, sorcerer. Let the Trials begin!"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_START_0,First you must best my Captain of the Guard in the Trial of Strength.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_START_1,Welcome to the Trial of Strength. Get ready to get your butt kicked.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_2_END_0,The true test begins in the next chamber. Prepare yourselves.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_0,The final test in the Trial of Strength stands before you.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_1,He is known as the Unbreakable. Nothing will pierce his skin.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_INTRO_2,"Defeat him, and you will move on to the second trial."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_START_0,Bring it on.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LUKE CAGE</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_3_END_0,"Most impressive. Though the next trial will prove more difficult, I am sure of it."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_0,The second trial will put your team's wits and reflexes to the test.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_1,You must defeat my blind Seer: The Daredevil.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_INTRO_2,This should be fun.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_4_START_0,"I can sense your fear. But don't worry, this will all be over with soon enough."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_0,We have two more trials to get through.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_1,And then King Thor will give us the Warlock's Eye.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_2,I still think we should just take it from him by force.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_3,"That way only makes enemies, not allies. And we need all the allies we can get."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_INTRO_4,Very well. Bring on the next challenge.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_START_0,Catch me if you can.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_5_END_0,The final test of this trial lies ahead. Good luck. You will need it.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_0,Who do you have in store for us now?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_1,"Why none other than my brother, Loki himself!"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_INTRO_2,"He is a master of trickery. If you defeat him, you will be worthy of the third trial."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_START_0,"This sort of thing bores me. Let's get it over with, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_START_1,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>LOKI</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_6_END_0,Hah! Seeing Loki be defeated gets me EVERY time. On to the final trial you go.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_INTRO_0,The third trial begins with a test against the best headhunters from across the entire realm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_INTRO_1,Defeat them to proceed.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_START_0,"I suggested a dance-off, but King Thor says this has to be a trial by combat."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_7_START_1,Oh well...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_INTRO_0,"In order to be worthy of the final test, you must defeat my champions once again... all at once."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_INTRO_1,That sounds... challenging.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_INTRO_2,The test of a true warrior.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_START_0,Now let's see how you fare against us at full strength.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_8_END_0,Well done. Come with me to the next chamber to face the final challenge.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_0,"You have proven to be quite impressive, fighting against great champions and numbers."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_1,"If you wish me to grant you the Warlock's Eye, you have but one simple task remaining."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_2,You must defeat me.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_3,Just you?
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_INTRO_4,HAH! I like your spirit! Now let's see how you fare against the ruler of this realm.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_START_0,We must combine our strengths and wits if we have any hope of defeating Thor.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_START_1,<color=#fff568>THOR THE GOD KING</color> IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_0,Well done! I am honor-bound to fulfill your request...
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_1,"...and grant you use of the Warlock's Eye. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_2,"But I must ask, what use have you of this powerful artifact?"
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_3,We need it to enter the Nexus of all Realities to defeat an interdimensional alien invasion from destroying the Multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_4,"When put that way, I probably should have just given it to you in the first place."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_5,"Regardless, you have proven worthy allies. "
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_6,"If you need help from the Kingdom of Asgard, we will come to your aid."
ID_DIALOG_MYS_3_9_END_7,"Thank you, Thor Odinson. And now we must return to our home and find a way to save it."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_0,"Sir, we're getting some strange readings..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_1,"This is S.T.R.I.K.E., agent. All we get are strange readings from other dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_2,"Well, that's the thing, sir. Some of these readings are, um, coming from inside the Helicarrier. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_3,MOMENTS LATER...
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_4,What. Have you done. To my Helicarrier?!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_5,One word. Cool upgrades!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_6,"With Iso-8 and my Large Hadron Kaleidoscope, we can make our forces stronger, smarter, and probably better looking!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_7,S.T.R.I.K.E. Rule One: You want to build a dangerous-looking device?! You ASK.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_8,For permission or forgiveness?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_9,"Permission! This thing's giving off all kinds of weird energy. In fact, we're picking up the same energy from the other side of the solar system."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_INTRO_10,Wait?! Iso-8 energy?!\nWe gotta get it! Quickly! To space!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_START_0,We tracked the Iso-8 energy signature to this spot where Ultimus kept breaking into our reality.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_START_1,"Probably plenty of Iso-8, and not anyone else in sight! We have it to ourselves!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_START_2,--kzzzt ELEMENT HARVEST COMMENCING kzzt--
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_START_3,"OH, COME ON!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_END_0,Hmmm... How did Ultron find out about this Iso-8 before I did?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_END_1,"Sure, he's a super-intelligent android who's managed to outthink the Avengers. But he doesn't have Supreme in his name!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_02_END_2,"If we want this Iso-8 all to ourselves, we're going to have to clear out these drones. Okay, everyone! Time to go to work!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_0,"Supreme, report in. This was supposed to be a quick mission. Retrieve some of that material and return."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_1,"Ultron's drones are here, gathering up the Iso-8. It's creepy, they're like big silver ants."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_2,Ultron? How did he find out about this?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_3,There is nothing you humans can conceive of that Ultron cannot.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_4,Studying the portals created by Ultimus led me to discover this new element left behind in the fallout.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_5,"With my advanced technology, I can harness Iso-8 to do the impossible and improve upon my perfection!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_INTRO_6,"I'm terrified of you, but I've got to be honest - I like your style."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_START_0,Leave this Iso-8 to me without a fight and your death will be marginally less painful.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_START_1,"Okay, but - and hear me out on this - I want it!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_END_0,"What you view as a victory does not even register as a setback for me, human!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_END_1,"I will seize the Iso-8 using my new technology and wipe you organics from the galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_END_2,"Yeah, we're the worst. We should probably surrender. Oh, hey, what's that over there?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_END_3,"SURPRISE E.M.P., YOU SILVER JERK!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_03_END_4,"I YOINKED HIS TECH, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_INTRO_0,"Scientist, what'd you find out there?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_INTRO_1,"Well, while retrieving the Iso-8, I also managed to ""invent"" this incredible little gadget..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_INTRO_2,S.T.R.I.K.E.! I have come to retrieve my stolen devices! And to deliver your destruction!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_INTRO_3,You're bringing a brigade of murderous robots down on us now?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_INTRO_4,"If I had to return every piece of technology I stole, I'd never get any mad science done at all!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_START_0,"Wow, I really thought I outran you! Are you like obsessed with me or something?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_START_1,My only obsession is with ending organic life-forms who stand in my way!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_START_2,That's me! I KNEW it!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_END_0,"Phew! That should be the end of Ultron, for now."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_04_END_1,Now to go back to my beautiful Large Hadron Kaleidoscope and start cranking out the Iso-8!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_0,Why are we only finding Iso-8 now? Where did it come from?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_1,"Psh, YOU'RE only finding it now! I discovered it as soon as Ultimus started turning our dimension into swiss cheese."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_2,"Iso-8 is a by-product of rips in the fabric of reality. Ultimus has torn the most holes in our dimension, so we have the most Iso-8."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_3,With my Large Hadron Kaleidoscope - I love saying that - we can harness it! And then A.I.M. will be back on top!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_4,"I'm going to get a speedboat!\nNo, a rocket!\nNo, a speedboat with rockets!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_5,Okay. And where exactly are you planning on keeping all of these highly powerful yet unstable crystals?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_6,"Way ahead of you, one-eye! I've got a team house hunting as we speak."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_INTRO_7,"And by house hunting I mean, ""re-taking our old A.I.M. facilities back by force."""
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_START_0,"Scientist, this is Graviton. We've arrived at our former A.I.M. lab, but we have bad news. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_START_1,It appears this lab has an infestation of Ultimus's brainwashed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_05_START_2,"Well, what are you waiting for? Get rid of 'em!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_INTRO_0,Graviton! What's your progress? I'm stuffing all this Iso-8 under my mattress up here.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_INTRO_1,These S.H.I.E.L.D. agents aren't going down easily. They've called in corrupted Avengers as back up.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_INTRO_2,"Wait, was that an explosion? And I'm missing it?!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_START_0,We'll sooner bring this lab down onto all our heads than let you take it from Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_START_1,"If we don't hurry, these S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are going to destroy the facility and crush us all!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_START_2,DEFEAT THE <color=#fff568>ENEMY OPERATORS</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_01_0,Charges set!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_02_0,Arming detonators!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_03_0,Begin the countdown!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,We couldn't stop them! This whole place is coming down around us!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_END_0,"We're victorious, but the damage done was too great. We'd risk disaster by storing the Iso-8 here."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_END_1,"Ugh, corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are SO rude! ...Next time try to get one of their brains for me. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_06_END_2,"Anyway, I have another location in mind. Pack your antlers, we're going to Canada!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_INTRO_0,We've arrived outside the warehouse. It's been heavily fortified.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_INTRO_1,"It'll be ideal for storing the Iso-8, but gaining entrance to take it back will prove... challenging."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_INTRO_2,Did you try knocking?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_INTRO_3,"Oh, I heard you and your team coming from a mile away. Please, try to run! I prefer a moving target."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_START_0,Like what me and my mercs have done with the place?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_START_1,Bullseye. An ill-behaved child who throws toys. I've never understood why everyone's so scared of you.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_START_2,"Jeez, Graviton, you're going to hurt my feelings. Tell you what... How about a demonstration?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_0,"We've decimated the mercenaries, but..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_1,No! No buts!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_2,…The interior suffered tremendous damage.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_3,"Hmmm, and repairs are really going to eat into our profit margins."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_4,"Who wants to live in Canada, anyway? Socialized medicine means fewer test subjects for us, and that's no good."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_07_END_5,"Graviton, you're going on one more trip!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_INTRO_0,This old A.I.M. stronghold is occupied by a small faction of corrupted Hydra. Should be easy to crush.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_INTRO_1,We'll send them back to Ultimus in pieces.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_INTRO_2,Ultimus? Ha! We serve only Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_INTRO_3,"What?! What gives, we're supposed to be on the same side."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_INTRO_4,Those of us who joined with S.T.R.I.K.E. were weak!\nHydra cannot be contained!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_START_0,"With the world in chaos and the so-called heroes of Earth preoccupied, now is the time for us to seize power! Hail Hydra!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_START_1,"Ugh, I hate to say it, but... evil game recognize evil game."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_END_0,"You know, we need a new catchphrase! 'Hail Hydra' is so snappy. It could be on t-shirts."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_END_1,"This is off the top of my head, but what about 'Ready... A.I.M... SCIENCE!'?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_08_END_2,It lacks a certain... pop.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_INTRO_0,"These Hydra agents are calling in reinforcements from A.I.M. double agents! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_INTRO_1,"Maybe there's a way to take them out without destroying this stronghold in the process. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_INTRO_2,Oooh! I've got just the thing.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_INTRO_3,Sending you one of my favorite A.I.M. scientists with a special surprise for these olive drab dorks.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_START_0,The device she's got will release a patented A.I.M. formula that should take care of our little Hydra problem!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_START_1,See if you can guess the secret ingredient! Hint: It's poison!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_START_2,PROTECT YOUR <color=#fff568>OPERATOR</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_01_0,Coalescing gaseous elements...
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_02_0,Loading into the vaporator chamber...
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_03_0,Elements catalyst combining!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,Our agent with the toxic gas was taken out! Retreat!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_END_0,"The toxin did its job. The remaining enemies are, let's say, no longer a problem."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_END_1,"Well, sweep 'em aside and put down some shag carpet."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_09_END_2,Mama's coming home and bringing her Iso-8 with her!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_INTRO_0,We've finally loaded all the Iso-8. It'll be safe here until it is ready for the Large Hadron Kaleidoscope.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_INTRO_1,Perfect! What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_INTRO_2,"Well, look at what we got here! Y'all put together some kind of super-sciencey clubhouse?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_INTRO_3,"We're gonna have to make ourselves at home, maybe relieve you of some of this here Iso-8!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_INTRO_4,"Ah, that. That could go wrong."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_START_0,How did these slovenly cretins know about Iso-8?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_START_1,And how'd they know where to find us? This thing has more twists than Reed Richards wringing himself out after a bath.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_START_2,"If y'all are done yappin', I'd like to get to the thievin' and revenge!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_END_0,Someone else discovered Iso-8 technology?! And then predicted where we'd store ours? It seems impossible!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_END_1,"You're right. Hmm... to figure out where we were keeping Iso-8 and harness its power, you'd have to be a genius."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_END_2,"A beautiful genius, with an army of nerds in cool yellow armor..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_END_3,WAITAMINUTE! I know who's after us!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_1_10_END_4,It's me!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_0,"Press the attack, disciples! We take this island for the Hand and the glory of Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_1,"Daredevil, you know these spooky sword dorks better than me. At some point they'll get bored and go home, right?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_2,"We've been fighting this Hand siege of Hell's Kitchen for days now, so...\nI doubt it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_3,"You know, I love this town but occasionally it's hard to be an optimist in New York."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_4,"Well, if we don't get backup soon, it's going to get even harder."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_INTRO_5,"Is now soon enough for you? S.T.R.I.K.E.'s here, Daredevil. Let's finish this."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_START_0,"Nick Fury! We came to conquer Manhattan, but will happily destroy the head of S.T.R.I.K.E. in the process!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_START_1,"Nobu, someone's going to take me down one day. But when it happens, it's not going to be you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_0,"Their ranks are broken. We could have used that backup when this fight started, though..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_1,"In case you missed it, Daredevil, this is war. And soldiers hold the line."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_2,"What horn-head here is TRYING to say is ""thanks."" I can't believe you came down here yourself just to help us!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_3,"Actually, that's not why I'm here. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_4,"Ultimus's portals are damaging our reality immeasurably, and he keeps opening new ones. We're out of time."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_5,I'm ready to rally our forces and take the fight to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_1_END_6,But first there's someone in New York whose help I need.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_0,Dr. Richards. Is the device I asked for ready?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_1,"Almost. My invention creates an energy field that scrambles Ultimus's path to our reality from other dimensions, but it's temporary. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_2,I worry we're applying a gauze bandage to a wound that needs Unstable Molecule Stitches.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_3,"We just need a little time. While your tech keeps Earth safe, we journey to Ultimus's dimension and straight to his home planet -- Hala."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_4,"Then we destroy the Conversion Engine and stop Ultimus, along with his entire corrupted army."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_5,"Is that surgical enough for you, Dr. Richards?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_INTRO_6,"Wow, what a plan! Ultimus and I will have a good chuckle about it after I bring him your eye-patch as a trophy!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_START_0,Deadpool? How did you get past my security measures?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_START_1,"A gentleman never asks, and a lady never tells! But let's just say your vents are VERY dusty."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_START_2,Your S.H.I.E.L.D. agents can finish configuring the portal blocker. I'll take care of these mercenaries.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_START_3,PROTECT THE OPERATORS TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_01_0,"Okay, we've rerouted power from the Atomic Space Displacer! A few more steps to go."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_02_0,"The device is detecting the harmonic resonance of all connecting dimensions! If they disable it now, it'll be disastrous."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_03_0,I know a deus ex machina when I see one! This is our last chance to stop this thing!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,The device's containment protocols are damaged! Everyone evacuate the Baxter Building immediately!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_END_0,"The energy field is ready, but when we activate it, the timer begins. Ultimus's portals will collapse and he'll start repairing them."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_END_1,"It's now or never, Reed. Flipping that switch is the first step to securing Earth, and then the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_2_END_2,Do it.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_0,Our dimension is safe for the moment. I certainly hope the next step of your plan is ready.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_1,"Now that Ultimus can't reinforce his troops here on Earth, we hit them hard. Then we load up and head straight to Hala."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_2,I've been wanting to get face to face with Ultimus again. The Defenders are first in line.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_3,"Luke! Fury! My instruments are detecting something... Just before I locked us down, something got through!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_4,"Something sure did. And ""something"" is about to crush you and reopen this dimension for business."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_INTRO_5,"Fury, head to the next part of your plan. This corrupted Carol's not stopping anyone. We got this."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_START_0,"You're the saps Fury tricked into fighting back against Ultimus, huh? A Fury on our world tried that, too."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_START_1,Let's just say it didn't work out.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_END_0,"Fury, Captain Marvel's down.\nOne fewer threat left on Earth."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_END_1,"I'm forwarding you a set of coordinates. Once we've tied up our loose ends, gather your crew and meet us there."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_END_2,What kind of loose ends we talking about?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_END_3,"The mystical kind, halfway around the world. America? You're up."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_3_END_4,"All aboard the Chavez Express, mi gente. We're going for a ride."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_0,"Manhattan to Kamar-Taj in seconds flat. Nice work, America. You're on your way to being an Avenger one day, for sure."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_1,"Pfft, one day? You'd be lucky to have me any day, Arrow Boy."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_2,"Clint, if you're done embarrassing yourself, we need to find Doctor Strange."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_3,"I'm already here, Widow. Given the supernatural assault on Kamar-Taj, I've been keeping an eye out for any unannounced visitors. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_4,"The assault is why we're here. Fury's called all hands on deck, so let's shut down whoever's giving you trouble and get you to the rendezvous point."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_5,"I'm grateful - while I'm the Master of the Mystic Arts, I'm not too proud to accept help. Even from Hawkeye."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_INTRO_6,"Aw, come on! I know I'm half deaf, but I can still read lips. I'm standing right here."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_START_0,"Alright lads, we take this place and the supernatural energies of this Earth are basically ours!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_START_1,"The only thing you and your friends here are taking is a beating. Let's go, chica."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_MID_0,I have led Ultimus's forces to take the Kamar-Taj of countless worlds! Yours will be no different!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_END_0,Thank you. And you must thank Nick Fury for me as well.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_END_1,"Thank him yourself, Doc. He's waiting for you at these coordinates. We'll reconvene with you there later."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_END_2,For now we need to get to Muir Island. There's a mutant research facility and some X-Men that could use an assist.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_END_3,"Ready to go, crew?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_4_END_4,"After you, ""Arrow Boy."""
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_INTRO_0,"OK, Graviton. I got us in. Gather your intel on this world's mutants quickly. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_INTRO_1,That shouldn't be an issue. I can only imagine the genetic wonders this Muir Island lab contains.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_INTRO_2,"I've never surrendered a tactical position in my life, Graviton. You want this lab, you'll have to take it from the X-Men."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_INTRO_3,"Heh, I doubt your little group can hold off A.I.M. and the Brotherhood all alone."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_INTRO_4,"Oh, they're not alone."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_START_0,We've breached the perimeter. This fight's half over.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_START_1,Should we give them one more chance to surrender?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_START_2,Where's the fun in that?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_0,"I tried to tell you, Graviton. I've never given up ground. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_1,I wasn't going to start today.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_2,"Happy to help keep your perfect record intact, Cyclops."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_3,"Fury's taking the fight to Ultimus, and we need the X-Men."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_4,"Finally. Say when and where, bub."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_5,The when is now. As for the where...
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_5_END_6,Come with me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_0,"The Triskelion, Washington D.C."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_1,"S.T.R.I.K.E. agents, we've got precious little time so I'll keep this short."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_2,"Our dimension is safe from invasion, but temporarily. We have intel that disabling the Conversion Engine will free Ultimus's army."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_3,"And thanks to Phoenix and Ms. Chavez, we have a plan to trap Ultimus for good."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_4,"I've prepped a Helicarrier to cross the dimensions between us and Hala. We go there, take out Ultimus, and free the corrupted."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_5,And we end this war. Together.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_6,"Exactly right, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_INTRO_7,"One problem, Fury. Your Helicarrier is never leaving Earth, let alone this dimension!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_START_0,"I'm disappointed, Director. I was able to pinpoint the source of the energy blocking further invasions in no time at all."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_START_1,"And now my family can destroy you and your Helicarrier all at once. As an engineer, I have to say, I find the efficiency very pleasing."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_0,"You may get past me, but I can see your plan. You've scrambled the pathway to your dimension, but that also broke the way out. "
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_1,"The jump point to the next reality is outside the solar system, with thousands of Kree warships in your way. You'll be destroyed."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_2,I will say this about our Reed Richards: he never underestimated me.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_3,You think I don't know anyone who can deal with the Kree?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_4,"Along with general wanton destruction, it's kind of our thing."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_6_END_5,Someone toss this sad pile of rubber in the brig. We're launching this boat.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_0,"Wow, outer space! No matter how often I come here, I guess I'm still not used to it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_1,"I'm still not used to seeing hairless apes in red spandex, but you don't hear me yappin' about it."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_2,"Rocket, that Kree blockade will tear our Helicarrier apart. I need you to handle it if we're going to reach our jump point."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_3,"Got it, blow 'em all up. No problem."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_4,What? We don't have nearly enough firepower to take on that blockade! That's the point!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_5,"Star-Lord's right. I'm putting the Helicarrier into stealth mode. Take a team to the lead ship, sabotage the blockade, and we'll slip through."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_INTRO_6,"Got it, infiltration mode. In and out. And if something just HAPPENS to get blown up on the way out... let's just chalk it up to luck."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_START_0,"Good Fury! With the aid of the mighty Mjolnir, we are through the shield and have boarded the command ship!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_START_1,Blue alert! We have S.T.R.I.K.E. invaders! Fire at will!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_START_2,"Ah, I see Mjolnir's work is not yet done this day! Have at thee!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_END_0,"Okay, that takes care of the guards. Which way to the command center?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_END_1,"Looks like it's through this big sealed door. Oh, dear me, whatever is this thing I've taped to it?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_END_2,KA-BOOM!!!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_END_3,"Well, so much for the stealth part of this plan. I guess you got to blow something up after all."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_7_END_4,"Guess I got lucky. Which is to say, I make my own luck. And my own bombs."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_INTRO_0,"Hey, stretch guy! Can you manage to do something with these knobs and buzzers so Fury can get the Helicarrier through?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_INTRO_1,This Kree technology allows their ships to function as one unit. Disabling it should cause enough confusion to create an exit.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_INTRO_2,"Good Mister Fantastic, I have nothing but faith in you! Besides, who could Ultimus employ to match your titanic intellect?!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_INTRO_3,"Oh, do you Thors not have one of me on your world? Because I am definitely smarter than him."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_START_0,"I do not know what your plans are, but abandon them now and perhaps be spared."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_START_1,"Their plans are simple, brother! They wish to disrupt our ship's communication. But they didn't see this coming..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_START_2,"She's fusing Wakandan tech with the ship! If we don't stop her, I don't know how long it'll take to undo! We'll be out of time!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_START_3,STOP THE ENEMY OPERATORS AND DEFEAT ALL ENEMIES TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_01_0,Excellent work! Soon the Vibranium pulsing through this ship will make it impossible for them to disable.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_02_0,They're halfway to creating an all-new kind of technology! I would be impressed if it didn't mean certain doom for us.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_03_0,"Ha, this is child's play!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,With enough time I could decode this... but that's time we don't have. We must fall back.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_END_0,"I do not care if you won, I still think I'm smarter than you."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_END_1,"Maybe when your mind is clear. But with your thoughts clouded by Ultimus's will, your genius has sadly been compromised."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_8_END_2,There is a clarity of mind that comes with focusing only on saving others - that's why I won.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_INTRO_0,"Ha! Look at all them Kree ships, with their networks all scrambled! They're like farglings with their heads cut off!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_INTRO_1,Sorry... Farglings?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_INTRO_2,"You've never seen one? Well, when you cut their heads off, they get VERY angry. It's hilarious."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_INTRO_3,"Okay, that's enough weird analogies for one mission. Time to get to the Milano, on to the Helicarrier, and then..."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_INTRO_4,"Then... nothing. There is no future for any of you, S.T.R.I.K.E.\nSimply the end."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_START_0,"Prepare to be consumed by flame! Then, through my wrath, reborn as part of pure, cosmic power!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_START_1,"Ooh, the beautiful flaming bird seems extremely upset."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_START_2,"Doesn't take an empath to see that, Mantis! Rocket, you got any more explosives?"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_START_3,To do what with?! She IS an explosive!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_MID_0,I sense it... the Helicarrier. It's preparing to leave. Once I've destroyed you... I shall turn it to ash.
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_0,"Fury, this corrupted Phoenix is down, but I'm not sure for how long! And those Kree warships are already recalibrating!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_1,"We're boarding the Milano and on our way! If you're gonna jump that boat to another dimension, I'd get ready to do it now!"
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_2,That's our cue. Full speed through the Kree blockade!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_3,Doctor Strange? America? You ready?
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_4,"My ritual has begun. Ms. Chavez, if you open a portal, we can punch straight through the chain of realities to Hala."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_5,"Oh, I'm more than ready for Ultimus to catch these hands."
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_6,All crew! Prepare for interdimensional jump to planet Hala!
ID_DIALOG_HER_7_9_END_7,Ultimus... We're coming for you.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_0,Fury and his loyalists have left for Hala.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_1,The forcefield Richards built has sealed Earth away from the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_2,This war has weakened both S.T.R.I.K.E. and their corrupted enemies.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_3,It is time. Doom shall take back the Nexus from those unworthy drones and ensure an invasion of this magnitude never happens again.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_4,Deploy your forces.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_5,"Jawohl, Herr Doktor."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_6,We A.I.M. to please.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_7,"Get it? AIM? Like, that's our name. We're A.I.M."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_INTRO_8,The world is in our grasp! Show some decorum!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_START_0,A lone S.T.R.I.K.E. squad is assaulting a corrupted stronghold in Transia.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_START_1,We need to be rid of them. Cut their comms and the corrupted will finish them.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_START_2,Doom has spoken.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_END_0,We're being attacked from behind!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_END_1,I didn't escape my home dimension to die here. Hold the line!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_END_2,Fury left dimensional refugees behind to protect Earth. Fascinating!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_1_END_3,"Oooh, see if we can take them alive. I love getting new lab rats."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_0,S.T.R.I.K.E.'s force is overextended. The corrupted rally.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_1,Beat them down. Push them back.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_2,Teach them what all must learn: To defy Doom is death.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_3,We will bring them to their Doom!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_4,"You test Doom's patience, Supreme."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_INTRO_5,"My apologies, Doctor Doom. I just can't resist testing things. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_END_0,"Doom's forces have weakened both S.T.R.I.K.E. and the corrupted. Ultimus's last force on Earth is the First Legion. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_END_1,It is time for Doom's agent to reveal himself. Come forward!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_2_END_2,I've hidden among these invaders for too long. Now they shall feel the wrath of the Sub-Mariner!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_0,"Ronan, our perimeter is breached! Doom's forces are flooding in!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_1,"Hold strong! The First Legion will not fall here. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_2,"Namor, take a battalion to the left flank. We must defend this location for Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_3,"I think not, Ronan. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_4,Namor? What are you--
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_INTRO_5,Aaaaaagh!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_START_0,"Namor! You allied yourself with Ultimus, and now you betray him?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_START_1,Your master's mistake was thinking that Namor serves anyone's interests but his own.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_START_2,And now you pay the price for his hubris!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_END_0,"It's over, Ronan. Take your Odium and die swiftly."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_END_1,You... traitor...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_END_2,You invaders failed to recognize that Earth and its oceans are the dominion of royalty.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_3_END_3,Now Doom and I will cleanse this planet of your polluted stench once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_INTRO_0,"One by one, the dominos fall."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_INTRO_1,"With Fury away on his fool's errand, Doom's victory is assured. We must prevent his return."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_INTRO_2,"We can use the power that resides in K'un-Lun to fortify S.T.R.I.K.E.'s barrier, making it impenetrable to both technology and magic."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_INTRO_3,The Hand will reclaim K'un-Lun from Ultimus's mystics.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_INTRO_4,Make it so.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_START_0,You will never get past us. Ultimus shall prevail!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_END_0,Pitiful. Submitting to Ultimus has made you weak. This is what true power feels like!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_END_1,"The security here feels pretty low-key. Get it? Loki? I also have an Asgard joke... "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_4_END_2,"Your humor is ill-timed. Be careful not to disappoint Doom, lest you suffer the consequences."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_INTRO_0,A corrupted Sorcerer Supreme occupies K'un-Lun.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_INTRO_1,Their magical wards hinder the Hand's efforts.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_INTRO_2,The Hand are but journeymen. This task requires a master.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_INTRO_3,Let me show this pretender what mastery of the mystic arts truly means.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_START_0,"Another Mordo, challenging my power again. You never learn."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_5_END_0,"Your magic paled in comparison to the Strange I know, but it feels good to see that face humbled. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_INTRO_0,"K'un-Lun is ours, though sealing off Earth will require much more power."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_INTRO_1,Doom knows all. A deep mystical power also lies in the Savage Land.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_INTRO_2,First Legion scouts claimed it for Ultimus during the beginning of the invasion. Take it from them.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_START_0,"Invaders have breached the Savage Land! First Legion, to arms!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_START_1,The fools hope to resist. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_END_0,The Savage Land is ours.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_6_END_1,Excellent. Now little stands between me and complete control of Nexus Earth.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_0,Our foes have spent their strength. S.T.R.I.K.E.'s Triskelion headquarters is exposed.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_1,"Only a skeleton crew remains: supply officers, refugees... riffraff."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_2,Crush their resistance. Capture the Helicarrier.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_3,"My forces will overtake them. Hail Hydra! "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_4,A.I.M. is at your disposal.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_5,You have the Hand as well.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_INTRO_6,"By tonight, Nexus Earth will belong to Doom."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_START_0,Hold the line! We cannot fail here!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_END_0,You fought well. Doom's forces fought better.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_END_1,Seems to me like Doom hasn't lifted a finger this whole operation...
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_END_2,"You doubt Doom's power, Scientist Supreme? Perhaps you'd like a taste of it yourself."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_END_3,"Uh, no, sir, I'm good! Sorry, I thought I was using my inside voice... "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_7_END_4,Doom thought not.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_INTRO_0,Hunt down the remaining S.T.R.I.K.E. forces. None shall survive!
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_INTRO_1,"No problem! Hey, does anyone hear like... explosions? "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_INTRO_2,"That would be me. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_START_0,"So, I get to take out Doctor Doom and the Scientist Supreme. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_START_1,"When Fury told me to stay behind and guard the Triskelion, I didn't think I'd have a shot at you."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_END_0,"The so-called Punisher. You've lost, but Doom is merciful. Bow down before him and be spared."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_END_1,"Buddy, I'd sooner kiss The Thing. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_8_END_2,Those who do not serve Doom shall perish. Your choice seals your fate.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_INTRO_0,"This is our final stand! If we fall, nothing will stop Doom from taking Nexus Earth!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_INTRO_1,"I lost one home to Ultimus, I'm not going to lose another to these monsters."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_INTRO_2,Monster? Hardly.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_INTRO_3,"But if you insist, Doom will be the monster you fear. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_0,S.T.R.I.K.E. is in ruins. Your victory is complete.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_1,Nearly. One task remains: To claim the armies of Ultimus for our own.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_2,"Richards believed he sealed this dimension, but the way through is obvious to Doom's superior genius."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_3,"Through a combination of magic and technology, a portal has been created to Ultimus's Hala."
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_4,"Go, seize the Conversion Engine for our cause and see the fall of Fury and Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_5,The fate of all the oceans in the multiverse is in my hands.\nI shall not fail.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_6,"And, Namor? When we crush Richards and he sees the breadth of his failure, make certain he knows it was Doom who engineered it. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_7,With pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_8,"Namor, that trusting fool. Does he truly believe I will leave him his precious seas?"
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_9,"Once he has seized the Conversion Engine, my magic will strand him across the multiverse. "
ID_DIALOG_VIL_7_9_END_10,And then all of Earth will belong to Doom!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_0,THE EDGE OF KREE SPACE\nULTIMUS'S HOME DIMENSION...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_1,"Fury, we're through the final dimensional barrier.\nHala, dead ahead."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_2,"This is it. Ultimus doesn't know we're coming, but he's too smart to leave the Conversion Engine unguarded. Prepare for resistance."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_3,"Like, a bunch of Kree Warships about to intercept our Helicarrier?\nThat kind of resistance?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_INTRO_4,We're being boarded! Battle stations!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_START_0,"Kree soldiers! Get below decks, find our enemies, and leave no survivors!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_START_1,"These intruders won't live to see Hala. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_0,"Fury, Ultimus's attackers are down, but that was just the tip of the spear. There's an armada out there headed for us. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_1,"Let them, we're going to plow right through. Colonel Rhodes? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_2,"Yes, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_3,"Aim this boat at Hala, and don't stop until we hit the surface."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_1_END_4,"You got it. This isn't going to be smooth, everyone. Brace for impact!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_0,"Oof... Status report. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_1,"War Machine was able to ram the Helicarrier through the armada, and we crash-landed on Hala's surface. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_2,"There's a lot of wounded, but no casualties. And I don't know if this Helicarrier is ever going to fly again."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_3,"Whatever the Kree expected us to do, it probably wasn't that."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_4,"Hey, any landing you can walk away from, right?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_5,"We haven't walked away from it yet. We need to find the Conversion Engine, fast."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_INTRO_6,"Nexus Kree? Time to earn your keep. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_START_0,We can interface with Ultimus's Kree technology. We will be able to find the Conversion Engine; you just need to keep us safe.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_START_1,"You all heard the blue lady! We watch her back, no matter what!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_START_2,PROTECT THE KREE OPERATOR TO WIN
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_1_0,"We've accessed Ultimus's satellites. Scanning for power surges. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_2_0,"We've narrowed the location down to just a few facilities on Hala. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_3_0,The corrupted Kree here on Hala are trying to shut us out! I need more time!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_OPERATOR_FAIL_0,"We... were too late... "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_0,"We've located it! We know where the Conversion Engine is. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_1,"Finally, something goes right. Lock and load, everyone, we're leaving for those coordinates ASAP. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_2,"Hey, Fury? Every sensor in my suit started going off at once which is usually, you know... very bad."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_3,"Something's incoming! Everyone, take cover!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_2_END_4,"S.T.R.I.K.E.! You pushed through my armada, but now you must contend with me!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_0,"Congratulations, Nick Fury. I conquered countless Earths, but yours, somehow, continues to be a thorn in my side. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_1,"Your people have scraped and fought, only for you to bring them here, to die by my hand."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_2,I wasn't planning on dying today. Anyone else?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_3,"I already died once. Didn't much care for it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_4,"Pepper and I have dinner reservations, so dying today... that's not going to work for me."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_INTRO_5,"That settles it, then. S.T.R.I.K.E.? Assemble!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_START_0,You fools seek the Conversion Engine? Allow me to show you its power firsthand!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_0,"FURY! If you think a frontal attack can stop me, you're deluding yourself!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_1,He's not wrong. We're barely holding him off. What's the plan?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_2,Holding him off IS the plan. Star-Lord? Thor? You're up.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_3,We shall not fail.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_4,"Yes, we shan't. That's what I was going to say. Before I was so rudely interrupted."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_3_END_5,GO!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_0,"Okay, team Guardians. We're Fury's space team. That's our thing. So we're the best equipped to find the Conversion Engine."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_1,"Yes. And he sent the gorgeous space gods because they are even better than us. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_2,"Aye, the green one is correct. So, as leader of Asgard and ranking Avenger, I shall be in charge. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_3,"Woah, woah, hold up Hammers & Hobgoblins. Fury put me in charge."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_4,"Ha! A delightful jest, Lord of Stars. But the Mighty Thor is definitely in charge."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_INTRO_5,"Boys, boys, boys! I don't know WHAT Nick Fury told you, but... I am DEFINITELY the one in charge!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_START_0,Mister Sinister? YOU were the spy?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_START_1,You make it sound so covert and exciting! DO go on...
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_START_2,"If Sinister has betrayed Ultimus, then he has chosen death!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_START_3,"So sorry, let's put a pin in this convo for JUST a sec while we crush our foes, hmm?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_0,"Tell, Sinister, for what reason shall I believe thee?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_1,"Ultimus is letting me have a LOT of fun right now, but the minute he takes out your team, the party's over. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_2,"I cleared a path to the Conversion Engine for you, tall, godlike, and golden. So take your hammer and do your thing!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_3,"We are left with nary a choice. But hear me: if it's foul betrayal on your mind, I will bring the full force of Asgard down upon thee. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_4,"O.M.G., Thor's gonna Thor, I LOVE it. For now, though, I'll leave you boys to it! So long!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_4_END_5,"Well, I'm sure this is going to go great. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_0,"Wouldya look at that! Sinister wasn't kidding, it's right there. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_1,"The Conversion Engine. By Odin, the power emanating from it..."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_3,What did he say?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_INTRO_4,"He said it'll blow up REAL good. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_START_0,This is it! We eliminate these final guards and the Engine can be destroyed!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_START_1,You'll find that easier said than done! Destroy them!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_0,That's the last one! Can we blow this thing and get offa this flankran planet?!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_5_END_1,"Aye, angry furred one! Let us ""blow this thing"" indeed!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_0,"Rocket, plant the charges. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_1,"Nay. This device is filled with unknown power. Only the might of Mjolnir can be depended on to destroy it. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_2,"Look, Quill... I never thought I'd say this, but I think we should let someone other than me blow this thing up."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_3,"Foul machine, I strike at thee not just for the forces of S.T.R.I.K.E., but for all beings of free will! Feel the power of the God of Thunder!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_4,"Not today, Asgardian."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_5,"Holy crap! Ultimus took the full force of Thor's hammer for the machine! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_INTRO_6,"Now... now you have made me quite angry. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_START_0,"The great Nexus rebellion ends here! My empire will be built upon your ashes and my throne from your bones! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_0,"I stand here at the source of my power, the Conversion Engine, and that meager attack is all you have to defy me with?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_1,"Okay, we hit this guy with everything and now we're out of ammo... Thor? You're in charge. What's the plan?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_2,"We do as our allies did, Star-Lord. We fall in glorious battle!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_3,I was really hoping you'd have a better idea than that!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_4,"You pitiful things continue to resist, but you cannot stop me! No one in the multiverse can stop me! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_5,"Not so fast, Ultimus. We're not out of this fight yet. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_6_END_6,You have yet to face me.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_0,Fury?! I left you broken in the ruins of your Helicarrier.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_1,You think I'd use all my tricks right at the start of the fight? I thought you were supposed to be a master tactician.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_2,"Send as many mutants as you'd like, Fury. You can't defeat me. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_3,"I don't need to defeat you. I just need to imprison you. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_4,"America, Phoenix! Open the portal, now!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_5,"One-way trip to the M'Kraan Crystal dimension, comin' up."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_6,X-Men! Brotherhood! Drag him through!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_INTRO_7,ARRRGH!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_0,We're in the M'Kraan dimension... Where is Ultimus?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_1,"He's here, I can sense him. We must have been separated when we journeyed through your portal. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_2,"You two are the only way anyone's getting in or out of here, so let's get back before WE get separated."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_3,"Fellow mystics! S.T.R.I.K.E. has returned after leaving us trapped in this dimension! They cannot be allowed to escape. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_START_4,We don't have time for this. Take them out!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_0,"Ultimus's mystics are down, Fury. They'll be trapped here with their master."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_1,How about we get out of here before we end up stuck with 'em?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_2,"Wolverine is right. This dimension is too powerful a prison - America and I can create a way out, but who knows for how long. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_3,Then let's not waste any time. Let's get out of here before Ultimus finds his way back to us.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_7_END_4,Too late.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_0,"Capturing me in a dimension that's merged with the M'Kraan Crystal is ingenious, Fury. But now you're caught in your own trap!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_1,"Have your pawns open a portal back home. Let's finish this battle as warriors rather than as prisoners. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_INTRO_2,"You're fooling yourself, Ultimus. I'd sooner spend 1,000 years trapped in this dimension than release you back into the multiverse. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_START_0,"I have an eternity to break Chavez and Phoenix's wills and get them to release me, Fury."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_START_1,But I don't need you to be free. This dimension will be your tomb!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_0,"I am order incarnate, Fury! The Supreme Intelligence showed me a multiverse infected with free will! Without my control, chaos reigns!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_1,"I've heard that pitch before, Ultimus. I'll hear it again. But at least it won't be from you. Cyclops, hit him!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_2,"Everyone, back up!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_3,AAAAAARGH! NO!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_4,"He's staggered! Phoenix, America, get us out of here!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_5,"Portal's open, but it won't last!\nWe need to go now!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_8_END_6,Go! Go! Go!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_0,"HALA, ULTIMUS'S HOME DIMENSION"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_1,"They're back! Fury, what happened to Ultimus? Is it over?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_2,Almost... We just need to finally destroy the Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_3,"It will be my pleasure to dismantle this abomination bolt by bolt. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_4,"You have to go through me, Magneto."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_5,Namor?! Why would you stop us?
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_6,"Ultimus is defeated, but another despot will follow. We need the army of corrupted if we hope to stand against them in the future!"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_7,"For the good of Atlantis, the Sub-Mariner claims the Conversion Engine for Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_INTRO_8,Namor... You know we can't let you do that.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_0,"Namor, Doom is using you. You're trying to protect Atlantis, but you're giving dominion over it to Doom."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_START_1,"The devil I know, Susan. I'm sorry but leave the Conversion Engine in my hands or stand against me and perish."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_0,"Namor, you're defeated, but it's not too late to redeem yourself."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_1,"The Conversion Engine subverts the free will of anyone under its thrall. It turns them into slaves. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_2,You're not a tyrant. You're a king. I'm asking you to act like one.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_3,"Susan... You're right. Even Namor occasionally errs. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_4,"Now, stand aside as I do what I should have earlier. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_5,IMPERIOUS REX!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_6,Namor did it! He destroyed the Conversion Engine!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_7,"Quick question, though: then why is there still an army of red-eyed meanies outside?"
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_8,That COULD be my fault? Did I forget to tell you that destroying the engine won't ACTUALLY free the corrupted? My bad!
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_9,"It's POSSIBLE I told you that so I could rule over some dimensions Ultimus gave me with an army of corrupted? "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_10,"Don't worry though, I'll stick to my turf, and you guys stick to... Wherever, I guess!\nI don't REALLY care. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_11,"Anyway, I'm off to be the king of a bunch of worlds now! Stop by sometime, I just LOVE to entertain! "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_12,We never should have trusted Sinister.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_13,"We face larger problems than Sinister. While you were away... Doom has taken the Nexus dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_14,"Then we'll take it back. "
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_15,"Listen up. Today was a huge victory, but the fight isn't over. Doom, Sinister... They're just the start."
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_16,This war has left the multiverse in pieces. And we're the only ones who can pick them up.
ID_DIALOG_NEXUS_8_9_END_17,"S.T.R.I.K.E.? Time to get to work. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_0,The only way those bad guys could have known about the Iso-8 is if I told them! And the only way I'd do that is if I was corrupted!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_1,Ultimus must have his own (less supreme) Scientist Supreme out there working on Iso-8 and putting it in the wrong hands!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_2,"So you've been saying for about twenty minutes. But you still haven't said what you want ME to do about it. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_3,"Norn Stones! Infinity Stones! If anyone around this flying fortress is going to help me find some special rocks, it's going to be you. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_4,"You do have a point. Grant me some of this Iso-8 and I can use my magic to find more in the galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_INTRO_5,"Perfect! Once we find this other Scientist Supreme and destroy her Large Hadron Kaleidoscope, I'll be the only game in town! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_0,"Voila. One interdimensional A.I.M. lab, chock-full of Iso-8. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_1,"Intruders! I love intruders! They make incredible lab rats. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_2,GASP! It's you!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_3,You!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_4,Me?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_START_5,YOU!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_0,How DARE you steal my invention and use it for actual evil!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_1,What would YOU use it for?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_2,"Science! Pure and clear and neither good nor evil! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_3,"I'm going to give my henchmen extra arms and turn people into M.O.D.O.K.s, and if society wants to judge me, that's their hang-up!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_4,"My god... We're so beautiful when we're angry. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_5,"Too bad you've got to die anyway! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_01_END_6,"Aw, come on! Right in the middle of my big speech..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_INTRO_0,"Here's the deal. I can't have you destroying my Large Hadron Kaleidoscope.\nIt took me FOREVER to build. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_INTRO_1,"Well, we can't have you powering up Ultimus's forces with Iso-8."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_INTRO_2,"This is just like in junior high when I had a ponytail, and then the cool girls grew ponytails, and then they said I was copying THEM! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_INTRO_3,"Oh my god, what did you do?!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_INTRO_4,"I turned them into actual ponies. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_START_0,"I have a solution to this impasse. My underlings poison all of you, and then when you're dead, I get to keep my toys!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_START_1,"Wow, now you're trying to ruin POISON for me? I LOVE poison!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_END_0,My henchmen! I was using those!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_END_1,You should have sent more than that if you wanted to stop us!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_END_2,Good note! Open the cages!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_02_END_3,I'm sorry. Did she say cages?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_START_0,"Scientist, Loki, other S.T.R.I.K.E. Agents, meet my large adult sons!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_START_1,RAAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_START_2,They'll be covering my escape. Mostly with the sound of your bones breaking! See you at the next Mad Science convention!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_START_3,"Or not! You know, because they killed you!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_0,"Well, those extremely disgusting things are defeated. Any sign of your counterpart?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_1,She got away! Damn her ability to exit a room with style!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_2,"At least we have her Large Hadron Kaleidoscope! Just look at this baby. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_3,"True. Whatever corrupted version of A.I.M. she was running, it'll be a lot harder to make Iso-8 for Ultimus now. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_4,"Wait... You're right. She must have been running her own version of A.I.M.! With supplies and profits and everything... "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_5,"You know what this means, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_6,No?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_03_END_7,"HOSTILE TAKEOVER TIME, BABY!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_0,"Okay, if I wanted to take every single asset of an evil A.I.M., where would I start?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_1,Perhaps I might be of some assistance.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_2,Norman Osborn?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_3,"As a biologist and a CEO, I'm the only one who understands your goals. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_4,"The first rule of business is supply and demand. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_INTRO_5,"So we find their Iso-8 supply... and demand it. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_START_0,"We're under attack! Battle stations, everyone!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_START_1,"Ah, the sound of underlings scrambling."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_START_2,"The source of this other A.I.M.'s Iso-8 is sure to be in their computer banks. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_START_3,"We simply need to protect our S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator while they access the data. And do some damage in the process. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_START_4,PROTECT YOUR <color=#fff568>OPERATOR</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_01_0,"Accessing the corrupted A.I.M.'s files. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_02_0,"They've got a few different bases, narrowing them down..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_03_0,"I've almost got the coordinates! Just a few minutes more. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,Our operator has been defeated! We must retreat!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_END_0,I have the location of their Iso-8 supply! We're good to go!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_END_1,"I gotta hand it to you Normie, your plan is working!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_04_END_2,"We're not done yet. Now that we know where they're keeping their Iso-8, we need to pay them a little visit..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_0,"The intel we pulled indicates your corrupted counterpart is harvesting Iso-8 crystals using a Kree ship orbiting the planet Argor. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_1,We can go clean them out! I'll bring my biggest science bag!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_2,"Not only that, dear Scientist. To run the facility, it must be staffed with some of Ultimus's finest corrupted genius-level intellects. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_3,"Once we take out their defenses, we offer them a new job - harvesting Iso-8 for us."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_4,"Okay, but what if they refuse?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_INTRO_5,"Well... Let's just call them ""downsized."""
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_START_0,"Okay, nerds! Give us your Iso-8 and your undying loyalty to A.I.M.! Or else!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_START_1,"Our Scientist Supreme warned us there might be invaders. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_START_2,"Perhaps we can learn more about them, once we take them apart!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_END_0,"I really thought that recruitment drive would be more fruitful! Instead, they're mostly unconscious. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_END_1,"A shame, we could have used more underlings. Either way, this Iso-8 gathering facility is now ours!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_05_END_2,"Not yet it's not, ugly."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_START_0,"Killmonger?! What would cause a mercenary like you to throw in with Scientist Supreme? "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_START_1,"Iso-8. With it, no one in the multiverse stands a chance against me."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_START_2,"I protect this place, Scientist Supreme powers me up. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_START_3,"I know you're not talking about me, but it's SO confusing when you keep using my name!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_START_4,This is like the time we hired a second Jeff at our office all over again.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_END_0,Congratulations! You've done it. Your interdimensional counterpart's assets all belong to A.I.M. now.
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_END_1,And all we had to do to get them was a lot of grievous injury and property damage!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_END_2,I love free enterprise!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_END_3,"Yes, well, I'm glad you feel that way. Since now, whether you like it or not, A.I.M. can fall under the Oscorp umbrella. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_06_END_4,"With me, Norman Osborn, in charge!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_INTRO_0,"Really, Norman? You think YOU'RE going to take A.I.M. from MOI?! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_INTRO_1,"Of course. With the world at war and in chaos, now's exactly the time for me to seize as much power as I can. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_INTRO_2,"Think of it less as me taking something from you, and more that your company is free to thrive under my guidance. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_INTRO_3,"Now, if you would, come closer. My junior executives and I are excited to grant you severance!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_START_0,"I can't believe a slobbering, winged, goblin-man would double-cross me like this!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_START_1,"I mean, fool me once..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_0,"Osborn has fallen, Scientist. What would you have us do with this wretch?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_1,"Wow, GREAT question! I would love to mutate him, but he's already this weird... goblin... thing. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_2,"It just feels a little MUCH, you know?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_3,"Scientist... You and A.I.M. may have managed to stop me this time. But rest assured, I will unleash my fury upon you..."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_4,"Ooooh! Great idea, Norman!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_07_END_5,We'll turn you in to Fury!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_0,"Well, Osborn, we're almost back to S.T.R.I.K.E. HQ! What do you think? "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_1,"You can either just be indebted to me and A.I.M. for the rest of your scaly life... "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_2,Or we tell Fury you tried to betray S.T.R.I.K.E. for personal gain!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_3,"Ugh... As loathe as I am to say it, I choose to be in your debt. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_4,"I must say, Scientist Supreme, this is far more ruthless than I was expecting."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_5,"Shame on you, Osborn. Just because I'm a ton of fun doesn't mean I won't feed you to genetically engineered sharks!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_6,Scientist. We're arriving at the Helicarrier now. But our radar is saying...
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_INTRO_7,"It's under siege! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_START_0,"Press the attack, my Brotherhood! If S.T.R.I.K.E. takes our Large Hadron Kaleidoscope, we take theirs!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_START_1,"I thought that other me would have learned her lesson! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_START_2,"Guess we're going to have to send these lackeys back to her, A.I.M. style! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_0,"Now, Magneto. Don't you feel silly?"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_1,"Bah. You foolishly think this victory means your safety. But your Kaleidoscope and stolen Iso-8 will soon be ours. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_2,"Okay, well, in the meantime I'll be using it to kick your butts."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_3,"So long, mutant jerks! Tell your boss she should accept her losses like a big scientist and stay outta the Nexus!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_4,Why don't you tell her yourself?!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_08_END_5,"Dang! So, you're just as good at entrances as you are at exits? Respect."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_0,"You've stolen my resources, destroyed my hardware, pummelled my staff! I've officially gone from mad scientist to furious scientist!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_1,"Oh, get over it! It's nothing you weren't going to do to me!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_2,"Sure, but I didn't GET to! "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_3,So now we're taking your Large Hadron Kaleidoscope out of this Helicarrier! Or maybe I'll blow it up and kill us all!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_4,You haven't DECIDED yet?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_INTRO_5,It's whichever comes first!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_START_0,"First I'll crush you under my heel, then I'll retake the Iso-8 you stole from me. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_START_1,"If you think I'm just going to give up that sweet Iso, then you're crazier than I am! And you're me!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_0,No one's making any fancy getaways this time! Sorry!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_1,Ugh... What are you planning to do with me?
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_2,"Normally I'd LOVE to keep you around for stray experiments. Would REALLY save me the time it'd take to clone myself. "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_3,"But if you were the only other Scientist Supreme to come up with Iso-8, it must mean you're the second smartest one.  "
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_4,"So why don't we keep you around in case you have any other bright ideas! Graviton, take her to the brig!"
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_5,"Now, to start using our Iso-8! I'm sure someone else will patch up all the holes that evil me knocked into the walls."
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_6,Scientist! What have you done to my Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_ISO_2_09_END_7,"Ah, it's good to be back home."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_0,We're through the breach!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_1,"By my calculations, Fury, only three more dimensional jumps lay between us and Nexus Earth. We're practically home."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_2,*BOOM*
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_3,We're not there yet! What did we just land in the middle of?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_4,"We're being fired on by another Kree warship! Sensors detect Inhuman tech, though. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_5,That explains the extra oomph. We're not going to survive long unless we take the ship out. Any volunteers?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_INTRO_6,"Don't sweat it, Fury. The X-Men are on it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_START_0,"Attention, you have entered the domain of the Kree-Inhuman alliance. Surrender your stolen vessel and face Kree judgment!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_START_1,"The loathsome mutantkind among you will be exterminated, but the rest may yet plead for mercy."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_START_2,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy whittling down that big stick of yours, bub. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_END_0,Scott! The Kree console... These readings...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_END_1,"I see them, Storm."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_END_2,"Fury, this is Cyclops! This gunship is down, but three more are coming around. Earth's about to be blockaded!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_END_3,"We're going to have to land this boat while we can. Get your team back here ASAP! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_01_END_4,"Hey Slim, next time you want to volunteer us for a suicide mission on an alien ship? Let Spider-Man do it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_0,"Corrupted or not, why are those Kree and Inhumans working together to lock down this planet?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_1,"We're two dimensions from home, Crystal. The question is, how do we avoid them and get off this Earth?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_2,I can answer both of those questions if you two want to listen.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_3,Wha---? A Negasonic Teenage Warhead? How'd you find us?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_4,"You guys landed a giant Kree ship out of nowhere, it wasn't exactly subtle. You're obviously not from around here, and I need help."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_5,"With Ultimus gone, those Kree and Inhumans that attacked you are trying to like, take over our Earth or whatever. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_6,"Unfortunately, a bunch of corrupted Mutants want to be in charge, too, so they're at war. I just want their war to stop."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_INTRO_7,"Bonus, you help me blow up some of their stuff, it'll help you get past them and get wherever you're going. So, baldy... you in?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_START_0,"Okay, this facility in Greenland is where the corrupted Mutants stage their attacks. The collateral damage is crazy."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_START_1,"It also happens to be near a weak point in the dimensional fabric. We take these guys out, you can get out of here."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_START_2,Incredible. How did you figure that out?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_START_3,"Um, I'm disaffected. Not stupid. Let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_END_0,Mutants and invaders below! Prepare to bow to Inhuman rule!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_END_1,"Never! The Earth belongs to mutantkind, and we'll destroy any that stand in our way!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_END_2,"Looks like the commotion attracted the Inhumans! We're in the middle of this fight all over again. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_02_END_3,"Ugh. These guys are SO much drama. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_START_0,"Ground team, sitrep! Our ship is en route to the dimensional weak point above your location, but we're taking a lot of fire. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_START_1,"Oh, YOU'RE taking fire?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_START_2,"If this fighting doesn't stop, we're not going to make it out of this dimension! Do what you have to!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_0,Black Bolt and I have reached an agreement. S.T.R.I.K.E.? Negasonic's rebellion? You're both causing too much chaos.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_1,"We work together to destroy you for now, and then we settle the war for Earth afterward."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_2,"Fury, things are about to get worse down here! I'm not sure how we're going to get out..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_3,"Ugh, I've got to do everything myself. Get your friends out of here."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_4,"Wait, Negasonic...!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_5,*BOOM!*
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_6,My god... She destroyed the entire facility! I don't know if anything could survive that.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_03_END_7,"She bought us time.\nLet's not waste it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_INTRO_0,"Did we make it? I can't help but notice that none of us have been forcefully exploded. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_INTRO_1,"We made it. That Negasonic's sacrifice was tragic, but she gave us the chance we needed to reach this dimension."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_INTRO_2,"Okay, but where, exactly, is here?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_INTRO_3,"Intruders! I don't know if Ultimus sent you, but if you want our Earth, you'll have to get past me...\nPresident Stephen Strange!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_INTRO_4,"Oh, brother..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_START_0,"Look, Strange, we're not WITH Ultimus! We're the ones who took him out!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_START_1,"That may be, but I'm responsible for too many lives to take your word for it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_START_2,"Once you're detained, the Eye of Agamotto will determine the truth. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_START_3,We don't have time for this...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_END_0,"Hey! Hey! Stop! See, we're the good guys. We could have done so much more damage if we were with Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_END_1,"Wait, CAN we do more damage?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_END_2,No!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_04_END_3,"Perhaps you're right... We should speak. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_0,"I would apologize for striking first, but it's impossible to be too careful. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_1,"When Ultimus took this dimension, rich in magic, I battled his forces with everything I had. I thought you heralded his return."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_2,Glad I can give good news for once. You don't need to worry about Ultimus anymore. We imprisoned him. He's done.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_3,"Thank the Ancient One, what a relief. And the corrupted? Are they free?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_4,"It's complicated. Ultimus isn't around to lead them, but their wills are still broken and some very bad people are taking charge."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_5,"Strange! Your time in this office has reached its limits! Surrender the presidency to me and my compatriots at once. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_INTRO_6,See? He said it was complicated.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_START_0,"Mordo was one of the first that Ultimus corrupted, and with his powers even more of our mystic allies joined the enemy."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_05_START_1,"It pains me to wield my magic against them, but to protect our world, I won't hesitate. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_0,"The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restrain your pawns, Mordo! They're defeated!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_1,Dare you come forward so we can end this? Or are you too cowardly?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_2,"What you call cowardice, I call strategy! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_3,"As you weakened yourself on my soldiers, I've tapped into magics you can only imagine!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_4,BEHOLD!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_5,Can anyone tell these guys we were just planning on passing through to get back to the Nexus?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_INTRO_6,"Lock and load, Rocket. We're helping out."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_START_0,"Can your ego allow you to admit that I'm the better sorcerer, Strange? Or must I prove it?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_END_0,"Oh, Mordo. Once we were friends and allies. Look at what Ultimus has made of us."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_END_1,"Let the Mists of Munnopor transport you away until one day, we might be allies again. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_END_2,"I'm glad we could help out, Strange. But S.T.R.I.K.E. and I need to return to the Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_END_3,"Of course. If Ultimus is truly gone, countless worlds owe you a debt. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_06_END_4,"Be safe, S.T.R.I.K.E., and know that if Nexus Earth needs help, the Mystic States of this world stands ready to aid you."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_0,"Fury, according to every inter-dimensional chart we've assembled over the course of the war... We're finally here."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_1,"This dimension is directly adjacent to the Nexus, but due to the methods that Victor used to block us out..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_2,"We can't just get back home from anywhere. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_3,"If we want to end up on Earth, behind Doom's defenses... We need to land on this Earth and breakthrough."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_4,"This is where Ultimus staged his invasion. This Earth isn't going to be friendly, people. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_INTRO_5,Get ready for a fight!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_START_0,Super Soldiers! We knew the enemies of Ultimus would return! Fall in and take 'em down!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_START_1,"Pft, like we can't handle a couple of measly Super Soldiers?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_START_2,"Uh, Barton, I think they might ALL be Super Soldiers."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_START_3,Oh. Well. That's much worse.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_END_0,"Huff... Huff... Okay... About a dozen Captains America down, are we good to go home now?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_END_1,"Sorry, Hawkeye. We've secured our position, but breaking through Doom's defenses isn't a process that can be rushed. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_END_2,That means it's up to you to buy Reed here all the time he needs.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_07_END_3,"As long as I get to see the look on Doom's metal mug when we bust back into the Nexus, I can buy as much time as you need."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_0,"Namor, do you have the device Doom gave you? The one he claimed would let you return to the Nexus?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_1,"I don't know why you demanded I keep this cursed thing. Doom's insulted my honor, I should have cast it into space."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_2,"Because, as cunning as Victor is, his ego always gets the better of him. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_3,"He couldn't help but embed a sliver of a clue for getting through his defenses, confident I could never understand what he's created."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_4,"You're burying the lede here, Reed. Can you get us through?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_5,"Give me a lever big enough, Director Fury, and I can move the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_INTRO_6,"Boy, Stretcho, I sure hope that's a yes."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_START_0,Curses! These Super Soldiers are interfering with my ability to decode the device. Can you stop them?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_START_1,"Doctor Richards, I've been in space for too long. Taking out Hydra goons feels just like being home."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_START_2,DEFEAT THE ENEMY OPERATORS TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_01_0,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_01_1,"Their disruptions set my research back! Please, do what you can to stop them!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_02_0,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_02_1,"We're losing data! If this continues, our path home may be lost."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_03_0,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_03_1,"Their scrambling of this device is almost complete! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,"No, the device Namor gave us, it's useless now. We're trapped..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_0,I've done it! I've managed to descramble the path from this dimension back to Nexus!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_1,"What's the next step, Reed? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_2,"If we open a portal here on Earth and transport the Kree ship through, we should arrive without Doom ever knowing."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_3,"Uh, like that portal, opening there?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_4,S.T.R.I.K.E.! Fury! Richards! You believed you could return to Nexus Earth without Doom knowing?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_08_END_5,"You forget... Doom knows ALL. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_0,You fools thought Doom would be unprepared? Namor's betrayal was as inevitable as your sad attempts to reclaim what is now mine.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_1,"The moment Richards began to descramble the pathways back to Nexus, I was alerted. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_2,"You came this far because Doom allowed it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_3,"Crushing you when you thought you were close to victory is all the sweeter. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_4,"You haven't beaten us yet, Doom. You talk a big game, but we're taking you down."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_5,"Kings don't suffer the indignity of climbing down into the muck to fight with peasants, Fury.\nI have pawns for that."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_6,For Doom!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_INTRO_7,For Doom!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_START_0,"Your quest ends here, S.T.R.I.K.E.!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_MID_0,Nobu and the Hand were weak. You now face Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_0,"Two of your lieutenants down, Doom. What else you got?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_1,"You think those two were the extent of Doom's forces? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_2,"I stand at the helm of Earth's armies, and every corrupted agent you freed from Ultimus now serves Doom!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_3,"You have a broken Kree ship and a few dozen of Earth's heroes, lost to the winds of the cosmos. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_4,"We've got one more thing, Doom.\nWe've got a Helicarrier we rebuilt for this exact moment. You copy, Carol?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_5,"Coming in hot, Fury! All aboard, we're ramming this thing through to the Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_6,"You heard the lady, S.T.R.I.K.E.! We're going home."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_7,"You view this as a victory, but you're returning to a world where Doom rules! You'll be crushed immediately. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_1_09_END_8,"I'll take that challenge. See you on the other side, Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_0,"I see we're meeting in another of your ""safe houses"", eh, Fury? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_1,"Each time Doom finds one and drives us back underground, I wonder... how many of these hidden bases do you have?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_2,"I have more contingencies than you've got arms, Octavius. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_3,"Now, do you have anything constructive to add? Like, maybe, the intel your team was sent to acquire?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_4,"Ah, yes. Doom's takeover was met with shockingly little resistance. Few countries turned down his offer of iron-fisted prosperity. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_5,We learned Doom is sending an army to take one particularly pesky rebel nation that's never been conquered...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_6,"Wakanda. Director Fury, I cannot stay if my kingdom..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_INTRO_7,Your Highness. Go. But take backup.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_START_0,"Mercs, fall in line! Doom's forces aren't getting anywhere near Wakandan soil."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_START_1,"Your soldiers are efficient, Killmonger. But do not get comfortable here. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_START_2,"We can settle our history later, cuz. I'm looking forward to it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_END_0,"These invaders turn back so easily, brother! How did Doctor Doom conquer Earth if his forces can't even finish a fight?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_END_1,"They're falling back, but not retreating. That was only the first wave, Shuri."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_END_2,"Whatever Doom is up to, he has only begun his invasion of Wakanda. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_01_END_3,"Right you are, Your Highness. I come bearing a message. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_INTRO_0,"Emperor Doom speaks for himself. He sends this telepathic message to your subjects. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_INTRO_1,"Wakandans! Your nation prospered in the old world. Your ingenuity and resourcefulness have not gone unnoticed by Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_INTRO_2,"But the old world is gone. The one Doom has built in its ashes is stronger, safer, and ready for Wakanda to join it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_INTRO_3,"And if you refuse? I command the army Ultimus once wielded, as well as the forces of every nation on Earth. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_INTRO_4,Be added to my legion and continue to prosper... or be destroyed by the might of Doom!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_START_0,"Doom claims to be a genius, yet he makes the same threat every conqueror throughout history has made. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_START_1,Return to your master and tell him that Wakanda will remain free long after he is gone.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_START_2,"Did you think I was a mere messenger, Your Highness? Oh, darling, I'm not just the ""join us,"" I'm also the ""or else""!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_02_END_0,"You may be made of diamond, Ms. Frost... But my kingdom is made of Vibranium. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_INTRO_0,"North perimeter secure. But we got new alarms coming in. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_INTRO_1,These alarms are guarding the passages we built that lead underground to the Great Mound!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_INTRO_2,"How would Doom know about these, brother? The only ones who knew..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_INTRO_3,"Are you and I. I think I know how Doom discovered them. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_INTRO_4,"Quickly, we need to reach these intruders before it's too late!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_START_0,As I suspected. Doom has sent corrupted versions of ourselves to take Wakanda.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_START_1,"Wakanda bows to no outsiders. But perhaps the people of Nexus Wakanda will see their way to following us! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_START_2,Doom will control Wakanda... Once we remove the two of you!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_0,"Doom will not stop. Like Ultimus before him, his might is impossible to resist. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_1,"Unlike yours, our nation resisted Ultimus, and will continue to stand against Doom. Your will is just too broken to see it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_2,"But you are Wakandan, so we shall keep you in stasis here on Wakandan soil until you can be restored. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_3,"How'd the insurrection go, Your Highness?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_4,"Wakanda is safe for the moment, Director. But my sister and I must remain here. Doom is not likely to give up."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_5,"I understand, but when the resistance needs you... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_6,Of course.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_7,"Brother, is that Fury on the line? Excellent! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_8,"Upon our return, I checked our comms and someone has been attempting to reach you through us!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_03_END_9,A message from someone claiming to have intel... from Madripoor.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_0,THE ISLAND NATION OF MADRIPOOR...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_1,"Keep your wits about you. We haven't located our contact yet, and Madripoor is a dangerous place. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_2,"A whole island nation of criminals. This place is horrible, dark, and slimy. You'll fit right in, Gobby. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_3,"Grr. Fury sent us because my team knows the underworld, insect. I don't know why I must suffer YOUR presence. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_4,"Me? I'm here because letting you run around ""Crime Island"" unsupervised is like letting Galactus loose at a cosmic buffet. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_5,"Think of me as a guard, or a chaperone. Whichever annoys you the most."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_6,Goblin! We asked around about our mystery contact who reached out to S.T.R.I.K.E. and...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_7,Well? Spit it out! What did you learn?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_INTRO_8,They learned that you ain't supposed to go around askin' questions here in Madripoor. Or at least... you're about to.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_START_0,"You fools attracted too much attention! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_START_1,"Said the inconspicuous dinosaur man. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_START_2,We need to remove these mercenaries before whoever hired them finds out we're sniffing around!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_START_3,DEFEAT THE <color=#fff568>ENEMY OPERATORS</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_01_0,Calling this S.T.R.I.K.E. sighting in to Doom! The reward's gonna be huge!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_02_0,Lines of communication are open! Start transmitting their location!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_03_0,If we don't stop these guys now this mission's going to be over real quick!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,"Intel relayed to Doom! They're sending an army to stop these guys, we're gonna get paid!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_END_0,"Well, good news, all the new friends you guys made for us are unconscious."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_END_1,But we're no closer to finding whoever was trying to reach S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_04_END_2,"True. Luckily, with all the commotion you made... I was able to find you."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_0,"Mystique? You already work for S.T.R.I.K.E., why the theatrics?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_1,"I'm not your Mystique, genius. When S.T.R.I.K.E. rescued people from my dimension, I shape-shifted my way onto a transport. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_2,"Once I got here, it was simple enough for me to take over the Madripoor underworld. Until Doom."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_3,"Yeah, I imagine metal mouth can't be happy to have a whole island doing dirty deeds dirt cheap on his watch."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_4,"Doom's bad for business. So, when I got some interesting information about Latverian energy signatures..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_5,So you called up S.T.R.I.K.E. What have you got for us?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_6,"Not here, once we're clear I can... Wait, did you hear that?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_INTRO_7,*BOOM!*
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_START_0,"Breach is clear! We found the targets! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_START_1,The boss wants Mystique taken alive. The rest... Who cares?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_0,"They're down, but not out. Mystique, are you still with us?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_1,"Right here. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_2,"Never took you for the chivalrous type, Osborn."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_3,"Don't be flattered, you have information we need. Now, let's get out of here before this ""boss"" arrives."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_4,"Too late, ugly. And guess what... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_05_END_5,"There's two of us! Surprise. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_START_0,"So, you two morons have been running Doom's black ops team? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_START_1,"Such nasty names! And after we went to all this trouble of tracking you down to kill you! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_START_2,"We're putting an end to your operation, Mystique. And if we get to crack a few S.T.R.I.K.E. skulls in the process?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_START_3,Bonus!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_0,"They're finally falling back! Mystique, better give us that intel while we have the chance."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_1,"Right. An ex-Hydra scientist came to me for protection. He said there are surges of interdimensional energy in Latveria. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_2,"I took the data off of him and figured whatever it means... S.T.R.I.K.E. can figure it out. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_3,We'll get this to the big brains back at S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_4,Great. We can figure out my fee later.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_5,LATER...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_6,They're gone? Perfect. Did you plant the tracker?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_06_END_7,"Heh. Right under his big green scales. Osborn's leading us right to Nick Fury, and he has no idea. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_0,"From these readings, Doom isn't using the interdimensional energy to open portals. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_1,It's something different. But somehow familiar...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_2,"Um, sorry to break up the super genius society meeting, but I think I found a problem. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_3,"Parker, if you're not helping decode these readings, you ARE the problem."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_4,"My Spider-Sense has been going nuts around Osborn. I assumed it was just his breath, but it got stronger when we got to base. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_5,"I think Taskmaster might have planted a tracker on him. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_6,"That was hours ago. If Doom has tracked him back to this base, it means they must be... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_INTRO_7,Tony! Fury! Come in! We've got incoming!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_START_0,We've broken through the perimeter! For Emperor Doom!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_START_1,"Doom's got a Kree army now?! F.R.I.D.A.Y., look into getting me a Kree army, it seems neat. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_END_0,First wave of the Kree are down. Radar's picking up more forces coming in quick. A lot more.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_END_1,"Damn! Doom's got us cornered, he's coming in for the kill. We need to fall back."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_END_2,"One problem, Fury - Reed's only halfway through decoding that data. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_END_3,"If we leave now? Whatever Doom's up to stays a mystery. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_07_END_4,Then we hold the line. For as long as we can.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_0,"Reed, I need that data done, now. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_1,"I'm calculating 8,462 variant equations at once, Fury. Even I can only stretch myself so thin."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_2,"This base is about to become a crater, Dr. Richards. Go thinner. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_3,"Director Fury, we have an incoming transmission. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_4,And I'll bet my good eye I know who it's from.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_INTRO_5,"Nick Fury. Your resistance ends here. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_START_0,"How many of your bases must my corrupted soldiers destroy, Fury? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_START_1,How many times must your pathetic band scurry away like cockroaches before Doom crushes you under his heel?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_START_2,"You know what? Let's find out. You're the only thing on my schedule, Doom."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_END_0,"Fury, the data's calculated. My god, I know what Victor's up to. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_END_1,"Great! Let's learn about all the, you know, horror at the next rendezvous point, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_END_2,"You're going nowhere, S.T.R.I.K.E.! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_END_3,"Uh, that doesn't seem like a transmission, Fury. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_08_END_4,"Your arrogance has forced the hand of Doom! I shall destroy you myself, once and for all!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_0,"First you fall, Fury, then S.T.R.I.K.E. ends! With no resistance remaining, Doom takes his rightful place in the center of reality!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_1,"And people say I have an ego. See how much worse I could be? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_2,"Hey, uh, anyone else reading all the excess energy coming off Doom? Fury... I don't know that we can beat him."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_3,"Then we need to hold him off while we get our people to safety. The resistance can't end here. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_4,"I'll do what I can to hold him off, but I need serious backup. Like, not the guy made of bees. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_5,"I had something in mind. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_6,"You ready to hold up your side of our bargain? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_INTRO_7,"Oh, yes. Bring this so-called Doom to me. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_START_0,"Thanos, Doom. Doom, Thanos. You two should get along, you have a LOT in common."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_START_1,You humans. You let this petty tyrant take over your world?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_START_2,"You speak to someone who once ruled all of reality. Come, and I'll show you the difference between us."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_START_3,DOCTOR DOOM IS POWERED UP BY INTERDIMENSIONAL ENERGY AND CANNOT BE DEFEATED!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_START_4,PROTECT YOUR <color=#fff568>OPERATOR</color> IN ORDER TO EVAC THE BASE AND WIN.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_01_0,"Bow before me, Mad Titan. Surrender and perhaps Doom will be merciful. Perhaps. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_01_1,"Um, Doom's shrugging off blasts from Thanos's gauntlet now. I'd be impressed if I wasn't, you know, scared out of my mind."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_01_2,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_02_0,"The drop ship is here, people! Let's clear them a path so we can get out of here!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_03_0,Most of the team is evaced! Keep buying us time!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,"This is the end of your rebellion, Fury. But it is just the beginning... for Doom!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_0,You... have not bested me... yet... Doom...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_1,"Your perseverance is admirable, but you've lost, Thanos. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_2,"Watch, as I crush your precious gems to dust. Then, Doom will do the same to your bones..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_3,"Stark, we're clear! Get out of there!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_4,"Okay, big purp! Time to go! As much as I hate saving you, we're going to need you."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_5,"I will finish this fight, Stark... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_6,"Yeah, sure, you're very big and strong. Let's go before Doom catches up. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_7,What's this? Running again?!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_8,"Flee, then. This base crumbles and your next will fare no better! There is nowhere on Earth that you can hide!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_2_09_END_9," All... is Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_0,"Listen up. I know Doom handed us our butts. But Doctor Richards is the biggest brain in the room, and he says we can beat him if we act now."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_1,"Oh, this ought to be good..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_2,"Thank you, Director Fury. I believe Victor is drawing specific energy from other dimensions and channeling it into himself."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_3,"Which means, with infinite dimensions to draw power from, he will eventually become infinitely powerful. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_4,"Fortunately, the intel our team brought back let us locate the focal point of this energy - the heart of Castle Doom."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_5,"So that's where we go. We put every boot on the ground, break Doom's defenses, and block the flow of this energy."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_6,"Um, isn't there still a nearly infinite-powered Doom watching reruns in his living room right now? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_7,"There is. But this is S.T.R.I.K.E., Spider-Man. If saving the multiverse was easy, anyone could do it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_8,Director Fury? The Helicarrier is entering Latverian airspace and approaching the drop zone.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_INTRO_9,"Affirmative. Doom's got an army waiting for us down there, so stay low, watch each other's backs, and give 'em hell. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_START_0,"Hold the line! Any of you lets an intruder through to Doom's castle and you won't live long enough to regret it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_START_1,"More Hydra, eh? Whaddaya say, Runt? How about I cut them down to your size so you can deal with this mess?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_START_2,"These creeps are the only thing out here that stink worse than you, Creed. Let's get to it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_END_0,"Legion of the Hand, fall back! They've torn through our Hydra allies! Withdraw towards Castle Doom! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_END_1,"Aw, and we were just gettin' started. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_END_2,"Their retreat is tactical, my procyonid friend. We're trying to give the Avengers time to enter the Castle's premises..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_01_END_3,"And now that's where all the baddies are headed. Crap. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E., this is Captain America! Our Quinjet is headed straight to Castle Doom, I need a sitrep from the ground!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_1,The situation is that we're down here getting our hands dirty while you're up there in your private jet!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_2,"Ignore her, Cap. We're doing our best to work with these villains... but no one's particularly happy about it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_3,"We can deal with bruised egos later. What I need to know now is if we can clear Latveria's air defenses. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_4,"We're pushing through towards the castle now, but... Wait... My radar sense... EVERYONE GET DOWN, NOW!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_5,*BOOM!*
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_6,"Ta-daaaa! S.T.R.I.K.E., I'd like to introduce you to my new\n exploding A.I.M. henchmen!\nYou're going to LOVE them! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_INTRO_7,"For about sixty seconds, anyway... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_START_0,"What the-- S.S., what are you doing?! I thought you were working for S.T.R.I.K.E.?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_START_1,"Me, too! But I KIND of told Doom that A.I.M. would help him in exchange for a piece of that sweet world domination."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_START_2,"Besides, Scientist Supreme does what she likes! I'm not called 'Scientist Takes Orders From Any Old Schlub'!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_0,"Okay, I think we put on a good enough show! Nice work everyone! Pour a cooler of A.I.M.-brand\n'Sports Drink' on Nick Fury!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_1,Can someone tell me what this lemon-lime crazy person is talking about?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_2,"Double-double cross! I only signed up with Doom so I could swoop in now and help S.T.R.I.K.E.! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_3,Also because I wasn't sure if you'd win or not. Mama needs her bets hedged!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_4,"Now, let me just disable Doom's defenses for you and we can all bask in the radioactive glow of camaraderie. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_02_END_5,Cap? This is Daredevil. Unbelievably... You're in the clear.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_INTRO_0,"Okay, Doctor Richards. We're approaching the front line - the courtyard of Castle Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_INTRO_1,"Good heavens, it's a war zone down there. Victor, what have you done?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_INTRO_2,"Reed, I'm going down there regardless of the answer, but... you're sure you can stop him? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_INTRO_3,"There is no such thing as certainty where Doom is concerned, Captain. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_INTRO_4,"But I know where Doom is getting this energy. And knowledge is the greatest tool I have. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_START_0,"Doom's forces are headed straight for you, Cap!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_START_1,"You heard Falcon, soldiers! Ready up and HOLD THE LINE!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_0,RICHARDS! You dare defy me with this paltry force?!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_1,"I know what you've done Victor. That energy is your own, amplified - you're draining power from the other Dooms!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_2,"Not just draining them, Richards. By manipulating energy siphoned from the corrupted, I bent their will to my own!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_3,Behold! My army of Dooms!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_4,DOCTOR DOOM HAS UNLEASHED GREEN-EYED DOOMS FROM OTHER DIMENSIONS TO SERVE HIM.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_MID_5,"THESE ENEMIES CANNOT SUMMON DOOMBOTS, BUT LATVERIA'S RULER HAS PROVIDED SOME TO AID THEM."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_END_0,It figures Victor would have an army of himself. They're probably the only ones who can stand to hear him monologue.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_END_1,"And there's more pouring in, fast. We need the rest of S.T.R.I.K.E. to hold this line if we're going to make it in..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_END_2,"We look like we're getting tired to you, Cap? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_END_3,"Besides, every one of these fools is covered in metal. Magneto's gonna have a field day. We got this. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_03_END_4,"You heard the man! Avengers, Fantastic Four? Through the gates, now! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_0,"Duplicate Dooms. Great. How did you even know that's what he was up to, Reed?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_1,"Victor and I couldn't be further apart, morally, but we do think more alike than I'd care to admit."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_2,"Years ago, in my hubris, I assembled a group of my selves from other dimensions, thinking we could solve the multiverse's problems."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_3,"I tried to work with my doppelgangers, it only made sense that Doom would try to subsume his. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_4,"Yeah, well, not to be rude, but I can't help but notice that the multiverse has still got problems. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_INTRO_5,"Indeed. Letting my ego get the better of me didn't end well, Tony. Let's hope Doom fares no better."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_START_0,"My instruments indicate we're still several sub-basements above the source of Doom's power. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_START_1,Alert Emperor Doom! We've located the intruders! Take no prisoners!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_START_2,"Then call an elevator, Stretch-o! I'm gonna see if I can clobber these mooks before it gets here. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_END_0,"Woof, these goons are tougher than they look! I almost got my knuckles dusty!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_END_1,Is someone slowing down in their old age? That orange color must be from all the rust!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_04_END_2,"Yeah, yeah! Hold the blasted door, I'm on my way!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_0,"Okay, even for a dungeon, this is a lot of cages. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_1,"My armor's picking up a lot of corrupted energy coming from inside these cells. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_2,"These poor souls. Doom said he was siphoning energy from the corrupted. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_3,"Let's feel terrible for them later. For now, let's... Oh, no."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_4,"""Oh, no""?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_5,"The fight on the top level is wreaking havoc on the castle's systems... These cages are open. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_INTRO_6,Okay! I'll say it! I officially hate Latveria!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_START_0,"These beings... They are the ones who attacked our leader, Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_START_1,"First, we exact vengeance on them. Then, we do the same to Doom!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_END_0,"We've got them back behind bars, Tony! A little help?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_END_1,"F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s got the system back online, Cap. They're not going anywhere."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_05_END_2,"We can retrieve them once we've dealt with Doom. For now, we must push on. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_0,"Here it is... The source of Doom's power. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_1,"He's using his modified Time Platform to access every dimension from the Nexus simultaneously. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_2,"Admiring Doom's genius yet again, eh, Richards?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_3,"It's a shame you're incapable of truly understanding it! I've taken your pathetic ""Council of Reeds"" idea and perfected it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_4,"Rather compromise with my doppelgangers, I rule over them!\nI am the apex Doom,\nruler of Nexus Earth!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_INTRO_5,And now you and S.T.R.I.K.E. will at last be undone by my hand!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_START_0,"Captain, if you buy me enough time, I can dismantle the Time Platform and cut off Doom's power. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_START_1,"No offense, Doctor Richards, but I brought a more direct way to disable it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_START_2,HULK! SMASH!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_0,Doom's tech is repairing itself as quickly as the Hulk can dismantle it!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_1,"And with that futile effort, your petty resistance against Doom finally ends, S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_2,"Take solace that after I purge you from this reality, your destruction will be remembered as the first of Doom's infinite triumphs."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_3,"Victor, your portal! I'm detecting three beings coming through! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_4,"Brothers, we have arrived.\nThe Nexus of all realities.\nAt last. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_5,Hsssss... This world's Doom... His reach... Hasss finally exceeded his grasssp...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_6,Bring Nexus Doom to me! Let me rend him limb from limb!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_06_END_7,"Soon, the Nexus will tremble before us.\nLet it feel the might of the Three Dooms!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_0,"If you challenge Doom, you challenge destiny itself! Come and... Wait... My power?! What have you done?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_1,"Your ambition opened a conduit to your world for power, little Doom. But we tapped into it.\nAnd now we have it."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_2,"And... Hsss... We're using it... To send you far, far from here..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_3,"Okay, the Dooms are doing wizard stuff! Strange, you and your team are up!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_4,"By the Vishanti, this is worse than I feared! Tony, they're casting a banishment spell! I can't stop it!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_5,Ahhh... The heroes of Nexussss... Good. It's been too long... since I killed a Doctor Strange...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_INTRO_6,"I will have to sssssettle... For throwing you into the multiverse! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_START_0,Oof... Anyone else feel like they just got off the world's worst Lockjaw ride? Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_START_1,"A world between dimensions. I suspect this is where those three Dooms were lying in wait. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_START_2,"We can attempt to return, but it appears this void's occupants are eager to keep us here!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_END_0,"I'm not sure how many more gamma-irradiated magic-using versions of our friends I can fight before I start to lose my cool. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_07_END_1,"I guess we're going to find out the hard way, though."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_0,"Who are these lost souls, Strange? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_1,"From what the ley lines tell me, this was the home dimensions of those other Dooms, all folded upon each other. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_2,"Whatever tragedy befell their homes, these beings, warped by the energy the Three Dooms possess, are what remain."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_3,"I am loving the attention to detail, Doc, but can you get us out of here? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_4,"Doom's combination of magic and technology created this place. My magic isn't enough to set us free - I'll also need technology. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_INTRO_5,"Well, luckily I happen to be completely covered in the stuff. Let's get to work."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_START_0,"My armor's smart-adapting to this incantation Strange is casting, but it's slow! Buy us some time, team!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_MID_0,How many of these enemies are there?! We're so close...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_MID_1,"Even in this void, your incompetence is staggering, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_MID_2,"Yet here I am, debasing myself by aiding you. Stand aside and let Doom handle this."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_MID_3,"I don't like this, but I'm not in a position to look a gift tyrant in the mouth."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_0,"Okay, Doom, thanks for the assist. Now surrender, unless you want to find out what a Unibeam feels like in an interdimensional void. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_1,"Unleash your power and we die together, Stark. Or heed Doom's genius and we can settle our differences once we've escaped."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_2,"I'm sorry, do you not see our Sorcerer Supreme? Do you think his cool finger movements are for funsies?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_3,"Tony... I'm afraid he's right. The magic-wielding alternate Doctor Doom's enchantments are powerful beyond what I've seen. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_4,"I can unravel them. But I don't know how long it'll take, or how long your armor will hold out. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_5,"Whereas Doom has firsthand knowledge of the dark arts the usurpers wield. With our combined energies, I can return us instantly. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_6,"Before those other Dooms can wreck our home. Okay, Victor.\nMagic now. Repulsors soon."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_08_END_7,"Prepare yourselves, S.T.R.I.K.E., for the honor of serving DOOM!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_INTRO_0,Have your enchantments held? Do we have access to the warped energy?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_INTRO_1,Hsssss... Yes. Ultimus's energies... Our own... Combined we can spread our influence across the multiverse... And Doom will reign.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_INTRO_2,"You know, between Ultimus, our Doom, and now you three-time losers, I'm getting really tired of people reigning. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_INTRO_3,What?! How did you free yourselves?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_INTRO_4,"One word. DOOM. Face yours. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_START_0,"The world I left behind was a wasteland, Stark! I left your counterpart buried in its sands, rusting within his armor!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_START_1,You'll fare no better against me here!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_MID_01_0,Doom hassss... destroyed countless Avengers... and made deals... with countless demons to do so... Prepare to feel their POWER!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_MID_02_0,"Bah, both of my Doom brethren are PUNY! Face me, a Doom from a world of pure GAMMA!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_0,"You think standing your ground against us is a victory? It is FUTILITY! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_1,"Now that we have access to the Nexus, our reach can be infinite! Brothers, expand the portal!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_2,Consume all of Castle Doom and let it be reborn as our seat of power!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_3,"Oh my god… They're overloading their own portal! Tony, we have to leave, immediately!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_4,"Latveria is Doom's birthright! Castle Doom, my home! I'll not cede its throne to these pretenders!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_5,"Doom, in about five seconds, there's not going to BE a throne! We have to go, now!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_6,"All S.T.R.I.K.E. teams are clear!\nStark, give me a sit rep! Is your team clear of the blast?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_7,"We're good, Fury. But, we have three new problems to deal with, and Castle Doom has been replaced with a mass of swirling energy. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_3_09_END_8,We do have one thing though... We're bringing Doctor Doom in.\nOur Doctor Doom.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_0,"MANHATTAN, NEXUS EARTH..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_1,"We've got the mercs on the run! Don't let them get away, we're putting a stop to their looting now."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_2,"Man! One little global catastrophe and, poof! There goes the friendly neighborhood."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_3,"Drives me nuts, these crooks taking advantage of the chaos the three Dooms are causing. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_4,"They think just because the Avengers are dealing with Dooms, they're free to shake down the little guys."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_5,What they didn't count on is that we're big enough for everyone.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_6,"Gather round, kids! Luke's giving a big speech again! I love when he does this."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_INTRO_7,"Got no time for a speech today, Spidey. Let's make these mercs regret stepping foot in New York. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_START_0,"We made it to the extraction point! Phew, I think we lost 'em. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_START_1,"Yeah, you got away from us clean. Hey, wait a minute!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_START_2,Heroes! Get 'em!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_MID_0,"Well, well, I see Fury's forces have found us, even as we operated in secret. Impressive. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_MID_1,The green eyes... Some of these fools are working for Doom! What'd we stumble on?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_MID_2,Fight first! Then we can figure out whatever's going on later!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_END_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E.'s supposed to be chasing Doom's forces half a world away. What are they doing here? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_END_1,Something secret. Look - they were tunneling. Heading West?\nWhat's West of here?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_END_2,Good god. The villains are headed... to New Jersey! They'll be killed!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_END_3,Wait... West of here is Greenwich Village...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_01_END_4,"Doctor Strange's Sanctum!\nWe've got to go after them, now!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_0,"Okay, we followed the creepy tunnel into Doctor Strange's house, which is itself also QUITE creepy. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_1,Every time I get sucked into mystical madness I end up with the heebie-jeebies for weeks.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_2,You're pretty easily spooked for a guy who's half-spider.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_3,"Half spider?! Where'd you get that idea? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_4,"You're ""Spider-Man."" You wear a full-body suit, I just assumed you were covering eight eyes or fangs under there."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_5,"I'll have you know I'm very handsome! It's true! I used to be married to a supermodel. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_6,"Okay, now I KNOW you're lying."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_INTRO_7,"Aw, man."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_START_0,For years I've waited to tap into the powers of the Sanctum... Now we take it for our masters!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_START_1,"Sorry, Mordo, but you're not taking anything."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_START_2,"S.T.R.I.K.E.?! But no Strange... Without his aid, destroying you should be child's play! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_END_0,"Throw it in, Mordo! Whatever the Dooms sent you to do, we shut it down. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_END_1,"You fools. Who said that all three of the Dooms sent us? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_END_2,"Uh, Luke? They're opening up a portal? That's been a good thing for us once, total. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_END_3,"The Sssssanctum Sanctorum. Focal point of energy in the Nexussss. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_02_END_4,"And now it belongsss to DOOM. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_INTRO_0,"I would tell you heroesss to run... But soon, after I lay claim to these mystic forcesss... There will be nowhere to run. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_INTRO_1,"Well, good news - running away and giving up isn't really my thing. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_INTRO_2,"And I know I've complained about the mystical creepy arts being outside my spider-skill set, but luckily..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_INTRO_3,"I brought friends. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_START_0,"I don't know what dimension you're from, but I promise you've never felt anything like my powers. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_START_1,"You may be right, child... I sense something in you... Something Doom may USE."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_START_2,"You're not going to get anywhere near him! Cloak, let's end this creep!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_0,You... Your energiesss... They reek of DARKNESS... Darkness I can USE!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_1,ARRRGH!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_2,"Cloak!!! Someone help, Doom is tearing him apart!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_3,With thisss power... I can finally enter the darknesss and unleash it onto the Nexusss...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_4,"Not today! And not with all of Doctor Strange's stuff laying around! Hey, Doom! What's this do?! How about this?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_5,Fool! You have no idea what those artifactsss can do!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_6,What about if I use them ALL AT ONCE?!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_7,AAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_03_END_8,"Spider-Man!!! He stopped Doom but... He's gone. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_0,That mystic Doom escaped and Cloak survived... But we lost Spider-Man. There was a flash and he was just gone.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_1,"And with them, any clues as to what the Dooms are up to. Damn."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_2,I don't like this... But I'm out of options.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_3,"And so, Fury, you turn to Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_4,"We locked you up in this Helicarrier for good reason. But if you know what your counterparts are up to... Spill it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_5,"I'll help you, but simply because these pretenders are the only thing stopping me from reclaiming my throne. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_6,"If the Doom with mastery of mystic arts sought Strange's Sanctum, his allies will seek what they know as well. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_INTRO_7,The Doom who harnesses Gamma radiation will seek it out on our Earth... And I know where he will find it.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_START_0,"Fury sent us with ya to shut down this Gamma plant, Doom. But one false move and I'll peel you open like a tin can."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_START_1,Make your empty threats if they give you comfort.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_START_2,"Intruders! Lock this place down, we can't let them stop our operation!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_0,"That was a lot of security. What exactly is this place, Doom?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_1,"Watch your tone, Cyclops. Doom does not answer to foot soldiers. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_2,What about cosmic beings of immense power?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_3,"Fine. The Hulk's Gamma radiation is curious - its power isn't simply scientific, but mystical as well."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_4,"As the master of both realms, obviously, I built this place to harness it for the glory of Doom."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_04_END_5,"Well, sorry bub, but we're gonna tear it down. Actually... I ain't that sorry. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_0,"Curious, I thought the Hulk's Gamma radiation was purely scientific... You're saying there's a mystical component?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_1,"Bruce Banner harnessed something through science he couldn't possibly understand. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_2,"Gamma is the key to a door... A door to a dimension of power Doom attempted to access. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_3,"So you built this facility to pull ambient Gamma and focus it. Ingenious. Evil, but ingenious."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_4,"Unfortunately for you, ""evil"" and ""ingenious"" are two things we excel in combining."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_5,"You've walked right into your downfall, heroes. Witness what our masters have created with your own tools!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_INTRO_6,RAAAAAAARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_START_0,"Powered-up Hulks! X-Men, we've trained for this - alpha formation!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_START_1,"I gotta tell ya, Summers, I've had nightmares exactly like this. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_START_2,"Take out the A.I.M. agents operating the machines and they'll be easy pickings! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_START_3,DEFEAT THE ENEMY OPERATORS TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_01_0,"They're more than just powering the Hulks up, they're creating some kind of rift! We need to stop them!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_01_1,STAGE 1 / 4 COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_02_0,The Gamma is flowing through the Hulks and into our final device! Staying on target!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_02_1,STAGE 2 / 4 COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_03_0,One last Gamma burst and Nexus Earth belongs to the Dooms!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_03_1,STAGE 3 / 4 COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,RAAAAAAARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_0,"The device is destroyed and the A.I.M. agents are down. Are we clear, Doom?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_1,"Hm. This is my design, but those imposters have modified it. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_2,"There's something new at the center of it, something draining more Gamma than is safe. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_3,"Wait... I just caught a familiar scent. Summers, this ain't good."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_4,"You have freed me, insects. But in doing so, sealed your own fate! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_05_END_5,So swears Omega Red!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_INTRO_0,"Omega Red! Don't let this guy near ya, he can drain your life force. Leave it to those of us with a healin' factor. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_INTRO_1,"Your sad mutation will not save you! I could have destroyed you before my masters infused me with Gamma. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_INTRO_2,"I beat you before, and I beat the Hulk. Way I see it, this is a twofer. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_START_0,"Come X-Men, and see the face of your death!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_0,I... I feel strange... How are you doing this...?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_1,"It's called an old-fashioned whuppin', Arkady."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_2,"You give yourself too much credit, Wolverine... Something else is affecting Omega Red."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_3,"Not something. Someones. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_4,"We're siphoning the remaining Gamma from this sad husk... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_5,And using it in tandem... with what I learned at the Sssanctum... to open a gateway...
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_6,To the DARK DIMENSION!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_06_END_7,"And with this power, we shall pull Nexus Earth into it!!! BEHOLD!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_0,"Fury, come in! The Dooms have done something terrible... They've somehow dragged us into the Dark Dimension..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_1,"That'd explain why every psychic I got on payroll just got a nosebleed and the sky went black. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_2,What's your status?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_3,It's amplifying their powers somehow... We can't stand... against... ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_4,Cyclops? Cyclops! Report in?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_5,"Okay, the X-Men are down for the count. Sending in the experts."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_INTRO_6,Leave this to us.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_START_0,"We've arrived where the X-Men and Doom last reported in from. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_START_1,"Sad to report it's naught but Dark Dimension monsters here, love. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_START_2,"Then we contain them as best we can! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_END_0,"Stephen, these beasts from the Dark Dimension..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_END_1,"Corrupted versions of those we know. This place plays horrible tricks on the senses. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_07_END_2,"We can't let these demons distract us though. We must make finding the Dooms our first priority. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_0,"Finally... the powers of the Dark Dimension! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_1,"Why should we settle for destroying mere alternate worlds, when we could absorb the limitless energies here?!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_2,"Once we collapse this place... We will have no need for Nexusss... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_3,"We can destroy it and rule the Multiverssse... As GODSSS. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_4,"Not while we draw breath, monsters."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_5,"You face the combined powers of the mystic guardians of Nexus Earth, and as its Sorcerer Supreme... "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_INTRO_6,I say this madness ends NOW!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_START_0,"Here we stand, at the end of the world, with yet another Stephen Strange to pull apart. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_START_1,"Consider it an honor, to be the final sorcerer to die at the hands of Doom!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_0,"Argh! "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_1,"We told you, Sorcerer. With access to these energiesss... There is no greater power in the Multiverse..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_2,"Oh, I can think of one!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_3,Spider-Man?! You're alive?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_4,Hey Doc! Turns out all the times you told me not to touch your stuff? Good advice!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_5,"Whatever I used to save Cloak sent me here. But thankfully I've been up to some stuff that might just save the day. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_6,You?! You think YOU'RE powerful enough to stop us?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_7,"Me? No. But like I said, I've been busy.\nI made a bargain."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_08_END_8,"YOU FOOLS SEEK THE POWER OF THE DARK DIMENSION?! CONGRATULATIONS. YOU HAVE FOUND IT. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_0,Spider-Man... What have you done?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_1,"The right thing, I REALLY hope. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_2,No! Not when we're so close!\nThe limitless power!!!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_3,YOU PETTY DOOMS SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN YOUR DIMENSIONS. NOW... FEEL WHAT LIMITLESS POWER TRULY IS.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_4,ARRGH!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_5,"Okay, great, now that the bad guys are losing to the worse guy, can we please get Earth the heck out of here? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_6,"Without the Dooms keeping Earth here, we can transport it back to Nexus. We just need time before Dormammu..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_7,"AH. HELLO, STEPHEN. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_INTRO_8,"...turns his attention to us. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_START_0,"With the Seven Rings of Raggadorr, I repel you, Dormammu."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_START_1,"THIS IS MY HOME, STRANGE. YOUR TRICKS WILL NOT SAVE YOU. "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_0,"How's that teleportation spell coming, doc? "
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_1,"Wanda, your chaos magic, can you channel it into a Pentagram of Farallah?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_2,If we extend it across the globe... We can get the Earth home!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_3,"NOT SO FAST, LITTLE SORCERERS..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_4,"Do it, now!"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_5,FLASH!
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_6,"Oof! If I take my mask off to puke, everyone here already knows my secret identity, right?"
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_7,Nexus Earth is returned to its rightful place. With no sign of the Dooms.
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_8,Are you telling me we did it?\nWe're safe?
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_9,"Possibly. But to return home, we had to open a door. If Dormammu went through it..."
ID_DIALOG_DOOM_4_09_END_10,"It could be the end of everything. "
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E. Commander, good to finally meet you. The name's Carter. Captain Carter."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_1,Fury tells me you're the one who runs point on multiversal events?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_2,"Well, as you might have guessed, I'm not from around here. And I'm not the only one."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_3,"Director Fury, do you want to chime in and bring the Commander up to speed?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_4,"Thanks, Captain. Commander, as you know, our world has had its fair share of problems with visitors from other realities."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_5,"Ultimus opened a door, and though you managed to stop him, that business with Doom blew that door off its hinges."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_6,What we're dealing with now is the start of what I'm told is called an Incursion. Captain Carter here is only the beginning.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_7,"Before now, we were getting variants of heroes and villains from different realities that were pretty darn close to what we're used to."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_8,Now I'm told that we're going to be seeing a lot of strange things and people we've never encountered.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_9,"So I'm giving you a new mission, Commander. Together with the heroes from Project Rebirth, I want you to track down any new visitors."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_10,"If they're friendly, try to recruit them. If they're unfriendly… well, you know what to do."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_INTRO_11,"Good luck, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_START_0,<color=#fff568>Captain America (WWII)</color> is a variant of Steve Rogers from another reality.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_START_1,He and other <color=#fff568>Invader</color> characters are a powerful <color=#fff568>Skill</color> origin raid team.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_START_2,Use his <color=#fff568>Special Ability</color> to flip all negative effects for himself and <color=#fff568>Invader</color> allies.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_01_START_3,Use his <color=#fff568>Ultimate Ability</color> to attack all enemies and apply <color=#fff568>Offense Down</color> and clear <color=#fff568>Defense Up</color>.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_INTRO_0,We're getting reports of strange activity in this area that may be connected to the Incursion.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_INTRO_1,"Wait, is that... it can't be!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_INTRO_2,Peggy? Is that you?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_INTRO_3,"Steve! Oh gods, it had to be you for our first mission didn't it? It's me, Steve, but I'm not the Peggy Carter you know."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_INTRO_4,"Aww what a touchin' reunion. Almost makes me all weepy. You'll surrender if ya know what's good for ya, loves."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_END_0,Who or what was that? What is going on? Why can't I raise Allied Command on my radio?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_END_1,"Steve, you've been pulled across universes, you're not in your world anymore."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_END_2,"Across... universes? Is this some kind of Hydra trick? Who are you, really?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_02_END_3,"Stand down, soldier. Captain Carter is the real deal. Holster that weapon, and we'll fill you in."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_INTRO_0,"So let me see if I got this right: the war is over, we won, and now it's decades later and I'm in another reality?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_INTRO_1,"Our war was won at great cost, but yours may still be going. At least in your universe."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_INTRO_2,"Then how do I get back? The Allies and my team need me. Bucky, Jack, Orson... we were in the middle of a battle."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_INTRO_3,"If they were with you, they were probably pulled into the rift as well. Once we get to safety, we can look for them."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_END_0,I feel like a man out of time. These enemies are like nothing I've fought before. And their eyes... why do they all glow?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_03_END_1,"That's more difficult to explain, but they're from other universes too. This world, Nexus, has had its share of troubles."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_0,Steve.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_1,Yeah?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_2,New Steve.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_3,"Do I know you, soldier?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_4,In a manner of speaking. Who did you say you were fighting with when you got sucked to this world?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_5,"A Brit called Union Jack, a crack shot named Orson Randall, and my best friend Bucky Barnes."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_INTRO_6,...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_END_0,"New Steve, you should probably know..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_END_1,"You're Bucky from this world, aren't you?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_END_2,How did you know?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_END_3,What kind of best friend would I be if I didn't?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_05_END_4,"Told ya, Buck. That'll be $5."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_INTRO_0,Why are there so many enemies coming after us? Is there a war going on in this world?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_INTRO_1,"Not exactly. When Ultimus was defeated, his control over his forces was broken, but they're still around."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_INTRO_2,He supposedly conquered hundreds of realities. And one of the standing orders he implanted was to investigate rifts and rift travelers.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_INTRO_3,"So to them, until you've been here awhile, you're like a bright shining beacon they feel compelled to investigate."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_INTRO_4,"That's fine, I can do this all day."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_END_0,"So what's the plan, Peggy?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_END_1,"Once we get to safety we'll start looking for any more interdimensional rifts, and hopefully we'll find your team."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_06_END_2,"After that, we'll take you to meet our Commander, and I'm sure he'll be able to help you."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_START_0,"Something's different about these enemies, everyone watch your six."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_MID_0,"Uh, Peggy? What's with the ominous look to that one?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_MID_1,I don't know. Let's find out.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_MID_2,Look at all this misplaced rift trash. You've been running long enough.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_MID_3,"You can't be allowed to interefere with our plans. Time to die, heroes."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_0,You think you've won? I'm only the first of many...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_1,You can't stop... what's coming...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_2,That definitely wasn't one of Ultimus' leftovers.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_3,"I'll put it in the report. In the meantime, let's see if we can find the rest of Steve's team."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_4,"And Steve... I know this isn't the battle you signed up for, but I know there's nobody else we'd rather be in this fight with."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_CAPWW2_08_END_5,"When this is all over, I promise I'll help you and your team find your way back home."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_0,"Mr. Walker, report."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_1,"Captain, the tech we nabbed from A.I.M. was definitely derived from Ultimus' alien tech."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_2,"The science division is still working on it, but we have a pretty substantial breakthrough already: A.I.M developed a rift tracker."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_3,Can we make use of it to find the rest of Captain Rogers' team?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_4,"Yes, ma'am. We've already got a solid probable location on the next rift."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_INTRO_5,"You heard the man, team. Kit up!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_START_0,"This is Bucky Barnes, a member of the Invaders from another reality."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_START_1,He and other <color=#fff568>Invader</color> characters are a powerful <color=#fff568>Skill</color> origin raid team.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_START_2,Use his <color=#fff568>Special Ability</color> to apply <color=#fff568>Offense Up</color> to all <color=#fff568>Invader</color> allies and to attack the primary target and adjacent enemies.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_START_3,Use his <color=#fff568>Ultimate Ability</color> to make an unavoidable piercing attack which repeats to adjacent enemies for each <color=#fff568>charge</color>.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDA_0,There will be no escape this time. The mutant failed. I will not.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDA_1,"What the... woah, big fella. I don't want any trouble. If you could just point me towards the war... I seem to have gotten a bit lost."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDA_2,Your war is over.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDB_0,"Get away from my friend, pal."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDB_1,Steve! About time you showed up.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDB_2,I wouldn't want you to have all the fun.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDB_3,"You know me, always at the center of the action."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_MIDB_4,"Ahh, the other one that got away. Good. I will bring both of your skulls to the king."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_END_0,"So, what did we get ourselves into this time?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_END_1,"High stakes, fate of the world sort of stuff. You know, the usual."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_END_2,And I suppose it has something to do with that wall of meat we just knocked out?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_01_END_3,"Yeah. I got some friends for you to meet, Buck. There's a lot to catch you up on."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_START_0,"Bucky Barnes, I'd like you to meet Captain Carter and her team. They helped Union Jack and I when we landed here."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_START_1,Ma'am. You're a bit... taller than the Margaret Carter I know. Steve says you're not her though?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_START_2,"Spot on, Mr. Barnes. We'll have time to bring you fully up to speed later. Right now, we fight."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_END_0,The red eyes really creep me out. Why do they attack us?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_END_1,"Residual mind control, I'm afraid. The one who used to give the orders is gone, so they are carrying out their basic instructions."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_END_2,And their basic instructions includes specifically attacking ME?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_END_3,"Not you exactly. When you fall through a rift, you have a kind of scent they are attracted to for awhile."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_02_END_4,"From what I was told, their old boss didn't want any competition. He had all his brainwashed forces actively on watch for other travelers."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_START_0,Who is this old boss you keep talking about that was mind controlling all these people?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_START_1,"It's hard to explain, and I don't really understand it myself."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_START_2,"Once we've rounded up your full team, I'll take you to meet my C.O. and you can ask him. He's from this world. He can explain it all."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_END_0,Really working up a sweat here.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_END_1,Push through. You're stronger than you know.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_END_2,"Woah, it speaks. And sounds... kinda familiar. Do I know you?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_04_END_3,"No. If you're lucky, you never will."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_START_0,You were a bit harsh on Bucky.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_START_1,Seeing him reminds me of someone I barely remember. It brings back a lot- most of it bad.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_START_2,"What, like that time Linda Goldstein threw her popcorn in your face at Coney Island?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_START_3,Heh. I'd forgotten about that.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_END_0,"As much as that other Bucky is you, he isn't. Same for the other Steve Rogers."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_END_1,"We're men out of time, Buck. Just like them. Hell, we might be the only two guys on Earth who can relate to what they're going through."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_END_2,You're right. What worries me is WHY they're here. We both know this is only the beginning. Something bad is coming. I feel it.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_END_3,"Me too, Buck. But at least when it finally goes down, we know who we'll be standing next to on the line."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_05_END_4,"What worries me isn't who we'll be next to, but who we'll be across from."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_START_0,"Stop, rift travelers. You go no further."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_START_1,And you are?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_START_2,"All you need to know is my king demands the heads of all the new visitors. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_START_3,Right back at you.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_MID_0,"Vibranium shields? My king was wise to target you. Come, let us end this. "
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_0,"More talk of a king. And variant or not, that was definitely Okoye, Shuri, and Nakia from Wakanda."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_1,What's a Wakanda?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_2,A good question for another time. My concern is I know who the king of Wakanda is in our world.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_3,"He's one of the wisest, strongest, and most noble men I've ever met. And if he's been corrupted in his world..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_4,Then whoever is pulling the strings must be very powerful.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_5,Yeah.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_6,Sounds to me like you guys could use a few new allies.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BUCKY_08_END_7,"You know, Buck, I think they just might."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_INTRO_0,"We've got another hit on the scanner, boys. Same frequency as you and your team, Steve."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_INTRO_1,Must be Orson. We'd better get a move on. Where's he showing up?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_INTRO_2,Just a little town on the coast you might have heard of.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_START_0,"This is <color=#fff568>Iron Fist (WWII)</color>, a member of the <color=#fff568>Invaders</color> from another reality."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_START_1,He and other <color=#fff568>Invader</color> characters are a powerful <color=#fff568>Skill</color> origin raid team.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_START_2,Use his <color=#fff568>Special Ability</color> to attack primary and adjacent targets and extend all positive effects by +1 for self and <color=#fff568>Invader</color> allies.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_START_3,Use his <color=#fff568>Ultimate Ability</color> to apply <color=#fff568>Stun</color> to the primary target and heal self and all <color=#fff568>Invader</color> allies.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_0,"[What the hell was that flash of light? This isn't France. Looks like New York. Smells like it, too.]"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_1,"Foolish trespasser. I don't know how you evaded our lookouts, but soon it won't matter. Hand, attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_2,[Hand? Hmph. Some things never change.]
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_3,You can't even imagine the mistake you just made.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_0,So it WAS a traveler I sensed.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_1,Something's not right. Look at that glow. He has the Fist.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_2,"Who are you, stranger?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_3,"The name's Orson Randall, but my enemies call me... IRON FIST!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_0,"Orson, duck!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_1,"Cap? "
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_2,"Hey, what am I, chopped liver?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_3,"Talk later, gents. It's fightin' time!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_END_0,"Cap, you want to clue me in on what's going on here?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_01_END_1,"Orson, let me introduce you to Captain Carter. Trust me, we've got a lot to catch up on."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_START_0,And that's about it. Any questions?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_START_1,"Your story sounds like bull, Lady. But I trust my eyes, I trust Cap, and that imposter DID have the Fist."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_START_2,Even if I barely broke a sweat. Guess K'un-Lun's getting lax on discipline in the future.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_START_3,"Enemies located! Hand, to me!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_END_0,Hmph. Looks like the city's got a garbage problem.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_END_1,"Before we leave and meet your Commander, let's take out the trash."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_02_END_2,"You know, a little workout might be just the thing."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_START_0,"The master was right; we have rift travelers. But you aren't the only visitors, strangers."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_START_1,The master has gifted us a bounty from worlds beyond!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_START_2,That's a lot of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_MID_0,I'll take the ugly one.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_MID_1,Which one's the ugly one?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_END_0,Useless creatures!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_END_1,Shall we go after him?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_04_END_2,Give him a bit of a head start. He'll draw more of his guys out of the shadows. Less work to hunt 'em down later.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_START_0,"Fools, you face the full fury of the Hand!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_START_1,10 of them for every one of us? Hardly seems fair... for them.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_MID_0,It looks like you fellas could use a hand with these Hand.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_MID_1,Who is that guy and why does it smell like rain all of a sudden?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_END_0,"Not as fun as fighting Nazis, but it helps me remember what it's like to feel something."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_END_1,Thanks for the assist... Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_END_2,"No trouble, ma'am."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_END_3,This world is bizarre.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_06_END_4,"Randall, you don't even know the half of it."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_INTRO_0,It looks like the gang's all here. And Captain Carter for a bonus.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_INTRO_1,Wong? No... you're not our Wong.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_INTRO_2,"No, I'm not. My reality was destroyed. And soon enough, yours will be too. They're too powerful to stop."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_INTRO_3,I'm really getting tired of this pronoun game. Tell me who you work for!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_INTRO_4,Make me.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_START_0,Been awhile since I fought someone from Kamar-Taj.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_START_1,"And yet, I destroyed a K'un-Lun last week. What a coincidence."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_START_2,"Oh yeah? Double or nothing, Sorcerer!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_0,"Now are you going to tell me who you work for, or do I have to take Mr. Randall here off the leash?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_1,*cough*
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_2,I was ordered by... Killmonger... of the Aphelions. But even he... serves a darker master...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_3,You can't win... nobody can stop them.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_4,Killmonger? Could that be the king those Wakandans were referencing?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_5,He's tried to seize the throne in our world several times. Maybe in his he succeeded?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_6,"Whatever all that means, it sounds like a solid lead. Maybe it's time we met your C.O., Peggy."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_IFWW2_08_END_7,"Right you are, Steve. And I'm sure Director Fury can't wait to meet all of you as well."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_0,"Gentlemen, may I introduce Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_1,"Director, meet the Invaders: Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Union Jack, and Iron Fist."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_2,"Living legends, in the flesh. Welcome to Nexus Earth, gentlemen. Captain Carter, you and your team are dismissed for now."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_3,Sir.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_4,"Director Fury, I think I speak for my entire team when I say: How can we help?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_5,"That's the kind of can-do attitude I love to hear, Captain. But first I want to see what you and your team can do."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_INTRO_6,"Head to the Training Room, I'll join you shortly."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_START_0,I'll be joining you boys for this exercise. I've always wanted to fight alongside the heroes of the Allies. Looks like now I get that chance.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_START_1,"This is Agent Coulson and his team, they will be conducting the combat assessment. Coulson."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_START_2,"Wow, I thought we were lucky when we had one Captain America. Now we have two?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_START_3,"Test now, fawn later, Agent."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_START_4,"Sorry. sir, it's just I get so.. well yeah. Sorry. Don't worry about hurting my team, they're actually LMDs. So don't hold back."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_MID_0,"Looks like they need a higher setting, Coulson. Reset the LMDs and kick it up a notch."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_END_0,"Well color me impressed. I knew you guys could kick butt, but seeing it is something else."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_END_1,"I don't get it, what are these things? Machines?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_01_END_2,LMD - Life Model Decoy. It's a kind of machine copy of a person and their powers. We get all the best toys.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_0,"So Cap, are we ever going to find out how they plan to get us back home or what?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_1,"Give 'em time, Orson. This world has been through a lot. But Peggy promised me she'd help us get back, and I trust her."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_2,"And well you should, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_3,Sir.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_4,"At ease, gentlemen. You've all been briefed on the history of my world and the incidents relating to an alien called Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_5,"As well as the situation with a megalomaniac who calls himself ""Doom""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_6,So I won't repeat what you already know. But what you don't know is that all this universe hopping has caused one hell of a mess.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_7,"And I need you gentlemen to help me clean it up. And in doing that, we might just save both of our worlds."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_8,"What can we do, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_INTRO_9,"Glad you asked, Captain. The four of you and I are going to go looking for a guy you might have heard of named ""Killmonger""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_START_0,Intel says our target is in the vicinity. Watch for a little girl in a big tech suit. Name is Ironheart. She's got something we need.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_MID_0,"Sir, that little girl has some big friends."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_MID_1,"Aww, are the big muscle men scared of me and my friends? Good, you should be!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_END_0,"Boss, if you don't mind me asking, what are we doing exactly."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_02_END_1,"Watch and learn, Mr. Barnes. You want to hunt down a guy like Killmonger, you need specialized equipment."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_INTRO_0,"Intel says the Killmonger we're looking for is the king of Wakanda in his world, and is sporting some juiced up magic mojo."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_INTRO_1,"So if you want to find an extra dimensional extra magical Wakandan king who doesn't want to be found, you need three things:"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_INTRO_2,"A vibranium detector, a magic seeking spell, and a multiversal scanner to hook those up to."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_INTRO_3,"So, one down, two to go?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_INTRO_4,Bingo.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_START_0,"I'm busy right now, Fury. Go away."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_START_1,"I'm afraid I can't do that. I need something called the ""Seeking Scroll of Solomon"" and rumor has it you've got one."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_START_2,"If you think you and these mere mortals can take it from me, I invite you to try."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_END_0,"The scroll, NOW. Or I might start to think you're being uncooperative."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_END_1,"You're too late, Fury. Morgan Le Fay took my entire collection. Even I'm not fool enough to face her."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_03_END_2,That does complicate things.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_INTRO_0,"So let me see if I got this straight. We needed a thing from a wizard, but a different wizard took it before we got there?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_INTRO_1,Not just some wizard. Morgan Le Fay is one of the most dangerous mystically-inclined people on the planet.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_INTRO_2,Normally we'd get the Sorcerer Supreme to lend a hand with something like this but he's not returning my calls.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_INTRO_3,"So what's the play, Sir?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_INTRO_4,"Desperate long shot, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_START_0,"Gentlemen we need to borrow a communicator to contact Asgard. Just so happens, you are acquainted with the folks who have it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_START_1,It's S.H.I.E.L.D. and Captain America!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_START_2,"Sir, it will be our pleasure."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_MID_0,You know what they say cut off one head...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_MID_1,and two shall grow back in its place.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_04_END_0,"Good work, everyone."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_INTRO_0,"Earth to Asgard, come in Asgard. This is the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. I need to speak to Loki of Asgard."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_INTRO_1,Director Fury. To what do I owe the inconvenience of your contact?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_INTRO_2,"Stow the attitude, Loki. You owe me a favor, I'm calling to collect."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_INTRO_3,"Fine fine, tell me where to meet and I'll be there. But after this, we're even."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_START_0,An Asgardian and a bunch of soldiers? Do you really mean to confront me with such meager forces?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_START_1,THIS is your favor? You want my help taking down HER?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_START_2,That's the long and short of it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_0,"Next time you think about calling me, Fury, don't."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_1,"Hey pal, there are bigger things then your ego at play here. The fabric of reality is unraveling."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_2,What are you mewing on about?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_3,It's an Incursion. These guys are from another universe. And not that Ultimus business.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_4,"This is new, dangerous, and might just destroy our entire reality if we don't succeed."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_5,"An Incursion? Preposterous. What tiny minds you feeble humans have. I am a god, I do not fear your pitiful crisis."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_05_END_6,"Well you better start, because last I checked you live in the universe too."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_INTRO_0,"So we got the vibranium detector, we got that scroll, what's the last item on the shopping list?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_INTRO_1,We need a multiversal scanner. Something that can scan for specific frequencies of dimensional energy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_INTRO_2,Didn't we nab something like that from the guys in the beekeeper outfits?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_INTRO_3,Unfortunately that one won't do what we need. A.I.M. cobbled that together from tech they salvaged.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_INTRO_4,"If we want to be able to scan for Killmonger, we need to go to the same source they did."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_START_0,Are we in space?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_START_1,Fantastic. This world just keeps getting worse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_START_2,This ship used to belong to Ultimus. Its permanently locked in space and time to keep its cargo secure.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_START_3,How did that happen?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_START_4,Ask me about Reed Richards sometime.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_END_0,What are all these... pods?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_END_1,"This ship was Ultimus' dirty little secret. Every reality he invaded, the first thing he did was capture himself and store that variant here."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_END_2,"Each one of those pods has an Ultimus in stasis inside. After we defeated Ultimus, Reed Richards found this place."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_06_END_3,And we locked it in a pocket of spacetime just in case. Never know when a Kree warship filled with Ultimus variants will come in handy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_INTRO_0,"Get ready, team. The ship's multiversal scanner is locked to Ultimus DNA. So to use it, we're going to have to wake one up."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_INTRO_1,"This guy is a Kree Eternal. That may not mean anything to you, but trust me, he won't go down easy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_START_0,Warning. Warning. Stasis suspended for Ultimus 1315.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_START_1,"Who... I remember, it was me. And who are you? Tiny humans."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_START_2,"Calm down big blue, the version of you that put you on ice is gone. We just need..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_START_3,I care not what needs you have. You were supremely foolish to release me. Now I will inherit what my variant began.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_START_4,"KNEEL BEFORE ULTIMUS, WEAKLINGS!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_END_0,Really? THAT's the guy who started all this? He didn't seem so bad.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_END_1,"We've gotten a lot stronger in the five years since he showed up, Captain. Back then, we could barely stand against his forces."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_END_2,Nowadays it feels like every hero is an order of magnitude more powerful.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_END_3,"So, by that logic the enemies you face must be that much more powerful, too."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_07_END_4,"Anyone ever tell you you're a real ray of sunshine, Randall?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_INTRO_0,"Okay, plug this into this, that into that, say the words on the scroll and... okay scanner is doing its thing. Now we wait."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_INTRO_1,"Where'd you learn to work with all this random stuff, Fury?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_INTRO_2,"Oh, I didn't. Guy by the name of Forge lent me a hand in working out how to do it. He's the best there is at kitbashing in a pinch."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_INTRO_3,BEEP BOOP
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_INTRO_4,"Gentlemen, we have a location on Killmonger. Let's go."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_START_0,"Oh, so you're the one who found me. Good. That makes it easy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_START_1,"Killmonger, I don't know if you're aware of this but you're severely outnumbered and outgunned. I suggest you surrender."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_START_2,"Yeah, well, you don't know what you don't know, patches. I'm not like any Killmonger's you know. I got backing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_START_3,"My boys and I, we got REAL power from the man in the dark. Here's a taste."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_WAVE2_0,He hits like a train filled with trucks filled with bricks.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_WAVE2_1,Who IS this guy?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_WAVE3_0,Oh is this the best you can do? I admit you didn't go down as easy as the others we found droppin' into this world.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_WAVE3_1,"But you're still no match for the Aphelions. Your world's gonna end, just like all the others."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_WAVE3_2,Ultimus and Doom ain't got nothing on us.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_0,"Okay, this has been real, but it's time to go."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_1,Where did he go? What happened?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_2,I think he just CREATED a rift to escape.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_3,How is that possible? I thought you said rifts were the result of worlds colliding in this Incursion thing you told us about.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_4,"Everything we know says creating rifts intentionally is impossible. But, we just saw him do it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_5,"What do we do now, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_6,"For now, we head back to base. I want you all to link up with Captain Carter's team again and keep finding variants."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_08_END_7,"We've got the scanner on Ultimus ship going, with luck maybe we can find a way to track Killmonger and his ""Aphelions"" friends."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_0,"Sir, our ""contact"" is calling."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_1,Put him on.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_2,I understand you've seen the face of your enemy. I trust you believe me now?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_3,I believe you told me enough to get me to see what you wanted me to see. The question is why.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_4,"My reasons are my own, of course. Let's just say, your enemy and mine have some areas of overlap."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_5,"Someone I'm hunting is allied with the ones you're becoming aware of. So for now, our interests are in alignment."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_6,"As a... gesture of goodwill, I am sending you the location of an enemy you might actually be able to capture."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_INTRO_7,"He is, of course, quite powerful. Good luck. I'll contact you when it's time to take the fight to our mutual enemy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_START_0,What the hell? Is this some kind of sick joke?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_START_1,Looks like someone snitched.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_START_2,You're coming with me.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_START_3,"Funny, I was about to say the same thing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_END_0,"Hill, get the jet ready. We're taking the prisoner to visit someone who can help us get some answers."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_END_1,"Where to, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_INVADERS_09_END_2,"Westchester County, New York."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_0,"Long have we wandered this dead universe, little one. But do you sense it? The faintest flicker."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_1,Skree!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_2,"No, I'm afraid not. This flicker is known to me. And it is fitting, I suppose, that she should be the last to remain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_3,Sakaww?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_4,She holds a special power. With it as a catalyst I may finally be able to tear the shroud asunder and seek vengeance at last.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_INTRO_5,Let us not delay. The Goddess of Death awaits us.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_0,This is Vahl - The Last Asgardian.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_1,"When Ultimus attacked, they faced his generals in battle and collected many artifacts of power. Though, in the end, Ultimus proved too powerful."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_2,"Defeated but alive, Vahl wandered the Nine Realms, perfecting their skills against the endless undead left in Ultimus' wake."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_3,"Now, they seek the last flickering embers of power in their universe in hope of finding a way to follow Ultimus and extract vengeance upon him."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_4,"Vahl deals huge damage, can easily clear debuffs from themselves, and can reliably revive allies. Vahl also uses the new Expose mechanic to provide sustain, speed bar, and ability energy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_START_5,"They work best with the Bifrost mystic team, and are especially useful in raids."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_MID_0,And here I thought I was the only one left. Weren't you the one that took Ultimus' eye? I thought you were dead.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_MID_1,My story did not end that day. I am Vahl. I've come for the Odinforce.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_MID_2,Haven't you heard? Odin is dead. The Sovereign's power is mine.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_MID_3,Not for long.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_0,Such power... what ARE you? Could you be...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_1,I am the STORY of a dead people. Of a culture erased. Of a universe left barren.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_2,"You struck a deal, Goddess of Death. Did you truly believe a creature like Ultimus would honor your pact?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_3,How was I to know he had the Entropy Cascade? He enslaved gods and left only death in his wake. I was just as betrayed as you!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_4,"No, it is you who betrayed Asgard! And for that you must fall."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_5,"Fool. I know what you are! I am the last Asgardian, you cannot strike me down."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_6,Wrong.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_7,[Screams]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_01_END_8,*I* am the Last Asgardian.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_INTRO_0,Skaaaa kreeee kaw?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_INTRO_1,"Indeed, little one. When I fell in battle against Ultimus, a portion of the Odinforce clung to me and kept me alive."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_INTRO_2,"Now with Hela dead, the remainder of the Sovereign's Power has become mine."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_INTRO_3,"If we journey to the place Ultimus breached the Veil, I can follow him across realities."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_START_0,Who are you? This universe has no living souls left.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_START_1,That is a complicated question. And I'm afraid I have no time for... whoever you are.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_START_2,I've come to take that Phoenix from your universe. I have plans that require it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_START_3,Kawscarr!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_START_4,Well said!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_MID_0,Impossible. Who are you to wield such power?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_MID_1,"I am Vahl. Wielder of the Vahl-Force, Slayer of Surtur, Destroyer of the Destroyer, Maimer of Ultimus. I am the Last Asgardian."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_MID_2,"And you are not of this reality, which means you follow Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_MID_3,Ultimus? Do not be absurd.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_END_0,I admit you are stronger than I. But I know what you do not. Your Sovereign powers only work in this reality.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_END_1,"I do not serve Ultimus, but I know of him. If you want what I know, follow me. If you dare!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_END_2,"I sense he has slipped through the Veil. Whoever or whatever he is, if he knows of Ultimus..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_END_3,Kareesaw!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_02_END_4,Indeed. We must give chase.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_0,"Meanwhile, on Nexus Earth..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_1,"Firestar, what's the problem? Your message said it was urgent."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_2,You know those rifts we've been hearing about on the news? The ones dropping new heroes and villains all over the world?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_3,"I've heard about it, is that what you summoned the team for?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_4,"Yes. I can... ""sense"" them, kind of. Before they happen there's a burst of energy across the spectrum."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_INTRO_5,"Part of that is microwaves. And I'm sensing it in this area, right now!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_START_0,"Oh look, it's the Teenage Mutant Cancer Causer herself."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_START_1,And she brought the whole after school club with her! You kids here for a selfie or just waiting for the bus?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_START_2,Nobody talks to my girl Firestar that way without getting BURNED!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_START_3,Oh it's ON Pastelpool!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDA_0,The rift is opening!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDA_1,"Titania, quit playing around. I've got a shadow."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDA_2,Kang?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDA_3,You heard him. Finish these kids off! We're going to have company.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_0,This may be... the end...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_1,"No fair... Kang is too OP. He's a Summer Event-level badguy, not a random-rooftop-fight badguy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_2,HALT.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_3,Well hellooooo. And you are?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_4,"If you fight the one in purple, I am an ally."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_MIDB_5,Good enough for me!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_0,[He fled. Where am I?]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_1,"Wow, you're ridiculously powerful. You could probably give Sentry a run for his money!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_2,No kidding. You took out the entire Masters of Evil like they were nothing.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_3,I... I wield the Vahlfo-- Odinforce. The power of the Sovereign of Asgard.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_4,"Until the rift fully closed I was linked to my universe, and thus empowered."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_5,"Your... universe? It sounds like you have a story to tell, friend. What's your name?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_03_END_6,I am Vahl.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_0,Your entire universe was destroyed by Ultimus. I'm so sorry.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_1,I knew he was dangerous. Our world barely defeated him.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_2,Yeah and his red-eyed mind controlled minions are everywhere. They're a constant problem.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_3,Then Ultimus is vanquished? My revenge is... denied? Did the one in purple lie?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_4,There's rumors S.T.R.I.K.E. knows what happened to him. We can find out.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_INTRO_5,"Yeah, stick with us, Vahl! Let's take them to the Helicarrier everyone. Maybe someone there knows something."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_START_0,"Say, friends?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_START_1,"Ah what, chum?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_START_2,Was the Helicarrier always infested with variants who look like they want to see our manager?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_START_3,"You know, Deathy, I don't think it was."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_MID_0,These are the variants of which you spoke? They have the same red eyes as the forces Ultimus commanded in my universe.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_MID_1,"New Warriors? Not exactly what I was expecting, but I'll take what I can get. Get these variants off my helicarrier!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_END_0,"OMG! Nick Fury, I'm such a fan!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_END_1,You do good work for your age. And you... who or what are you? That's some major hardware you're carrying around.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_END_2,"I am Vahl, the Last Asgardian. I have come to your universe to kill the tyrant known as Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_04_END_3,You don't say? I think we should all have a chat.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_0,I'll lay it on the line for you all. What's happening across the world is nothing short of cataclysmic.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_1,"Other realities are colliding with ours. These ""Incursions"" are the source of the rifts and all the variants we're seeing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_2,I've already got two teams working to track down variants and hunt for info on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_3,"Congratulations, you all just became the third."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_4,What of Ultimus?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_5,"You help out with this, and I'll tell you everything. Hell, I'll personally take you to what's left of his ship if you want."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_INTRO_6,"I believe you are trustworthy, Nick Furyson. We have an accord."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_START_0,Are we sure working for Fury is the right thing to do? What can we really do about UNIVERSES COLLIDING?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_START_1,"And besides, we promised we'd help Vahl after they laid that beatdown on the Masters of Evil."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_START_2,"I am ageless. And, for now, trapped in your universe. I cannot pursue my vengeance if the universe I inhabit is annihilated."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_START_3,This is simply a new chapter in my story. That is all.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_MID_0,"Get ready, this rift is opening!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_MID_1,Heimdall! This isn't... wait that wasn't the Bifrost? Am I on Earth?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_MID_2,Odinson?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_MID_3,The rift traveler has emerged! Attack!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_END_0,"Who are you, why are you holding Surtur's sword, and why do you feel so oddly familiar?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_END_1,"You are in a new land, Thor Odinson. A new universe. These humans are friends, and can explain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_05_END_2,"As for I... I am Vahl. For now, that is all you need know."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_0,"What's on your mind, big n' broody? You're making a face that says ""I have an idea"". Or maybe you're just hungry? IDK."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_1,"Our encounter with Thor has given me an idea. If I am right, it may be able to save this universe."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_2,"And if I can save yours, it may atone for my inability to save my own. But this plan carries considerable danger."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_3,"We're with you, Vahl. Consider yourself an honorary New Warrior."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_4,Not that we're giving you a costume or a tag or anything. We're not all formal like that.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_5,So where to?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_INTRO_6,"I sense the one we need is on this world. Curiously, in the city where we first met."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_START_0,"Loki Laufyson, you are required to help save this universe from obliteration."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_START_1,Curious. How did you find me? My illusions are without equal.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_START_2,Wait a minute... why do I sense the Odinforce coming from you? Are you... you killed the old man in some other reality didn't you? I'm almost jealous.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_START_3,The Trickster sends his minions after us! To arms!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_0,Well whoever you are you do not disappoint. And you're obviously not from this provincial backwater. So what is it you want?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_1,"Hear me, Loki Laufyson. Hear the Story of Vahl, the Last Asgardian. Know me, as I knew you."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_2,"In my universe, you had grown beyond this mischievous persona. You were not Loki, God of Mischief."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_3,"You were the God of STORIES. And we were well acquainted. Allies, perhaps even friends."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_4,You could change a Story in the tapestry of fate as easily as you now create the illusion I speak to.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_5,I like where this is going. But how would I wield such... delicious power... to save this universe you claim is doomed?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_6,"Not you alone. Alone, you could not affect a change so great."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_VAHL_06_END_7,"But with the OTHER 2 Lokis I sense in this universe, perhaps you can."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_01_START_0,"This is Loki (Teen), a variant of Loki from another universe."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_01_START_1,"He is a strong healer that provides regeneration for himself and his allies. In raids, he provides a huge damage boost to allies with Regeneration."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_01_START_2,"Team with his Bifrost allies: Vahl, Loki, Sylvie, and Beta Ray Bill to take down the Mystic lane in the Incursion Raid!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_01_WAVE2_0,Finally! It was so boring in that other dimension. I bet I can have some real fun in this one.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_01_END_0,Boooooring. I wonder what else this world has to offer.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_INTRO_0,I sense one of the Loki variants we're seeking is near.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_INTRO_1,Can you sense anything more specific?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_INTRO_2,No.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_INTRO_3,Just look for the most handsome godly being in the area.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_INTRO_4,Says the one who can create perfect illusions of whatever he wants.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_START_0,"So... about that whole ""look for another Loki"" thing..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_START_1,We know we're in the right area at least.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_END_0,You must be the me from this world. What's with that form?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_END_1,A... Teenager? Delightful.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_02_END_2,Awww! Teen Loki! And is that Alligator Loki?! I loved that storyline!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_0,Who are you? I feel like I know you somehow.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_1,I am Vahl. We have never met.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_2,But you're Asgardian.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_3,I am.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_4,"Not much for conversation, are they?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_INTRO_5,"Hold that thought, enemies incoming."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_START_0,The variant we're after is a kid?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_START_1,"Idiotic mortal, I'm a god!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_START_2,"God, kid, doesn't matter. The one in the dark wants you."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_END_0,"The one in the dark? Cloak, does that mean anything to you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_END_1,Not really. It's vague.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_END_2,Many things dwell in the dark. But we now know something useful: someone is hunting variants.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_03_END_3,Anyone who hunts a god will soon learn to regret that decision.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_INTRO_0,Are you sure we haven't met before?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_INTRO_1,You sense our resonance. I KEEP stories. You are the God OF Stories.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_INTRO_2,It is how I know where you and the other are even across universes and time. Such is the power of stories.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_INTRO_3,I'm the god of what now?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_START_0,Skreee!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_START_1,You have... the Phoenix?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_START_2,"Halt, she is warning us. She senses an enemy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_START_3,Clever creature.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_END_0,"Why does the bird freak you out, Deathy?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_END_1,We're... opposites. It's Life. I'm Death.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_END_2,Sawkaaaw?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_END_3,"She means no offense, little one."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_04_END_4,Mrrrrrrrr!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_INTRO_0,So where is the last me?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_INTRO_1,"They are elusive. But they are not on Earth, that is clear."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_INTRO_2,Does that mean we get to go to ASGARD?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_INTRO_3,I do not sense their presence on Asgard.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_INTRO_4,Boo! Hiss!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_START_0,Enough of this. The hunter and Sinister failed. Capture the child and kill the rest.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_MID_0,I'm tired of getting attacked all the time. How are they finding us?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_MID_1,We aren't exactly inconspicuous.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_0,The verbose one has a point. We are being attacked far too often.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_1,"More of this ""one in the dark"" sending those Ultimus variants after us?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_2,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_3,"We count among our number two gods, a walking Asgardian armory, and whatever the one with the scythe is."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_4,We shall make short work of any who seek to defy us!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_5,It is not that simple. To do what must be done will render most of us vulnerable.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_6,Don't count the rest of us out either.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_7,"Far from it. But for this plan to work, we will need specialized aid."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_8,I suppose you have someone in mind then?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_9,I do.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_10,As long as it's not my idiot brother and his buffoonish coterie.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_11,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_12,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_13,"It was them, wasn't it?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_TL_05_END_14,I don't know what you're talking about. Summon the Bifrost. We go.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_START_0,This is Beta Ray Bill. A powerful ally of Asgard he wields Stormbreaker to devastating effect.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_START_1,"Beta Ray Bill is a Protector who deals high damage and gives his Bifrost allies defensive buffs. "
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_START_2,"His Ultimate deals greater and greater damage the more buffs Beta Ray Bill has. Paired with the effects he can gain from Bifrost allies, Beta Ray Bill can unleash some truly amazing damage."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_START_3,"Along with his Bifrost team allies, he is very useful in mystic lanes in raids."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDA_0,"Surrender the hammer and we will spare you, Korbinite."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDA_1,"You make a mockery of the Lady Sif, imposter. I will never surrender Stormbreaker."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDA_2,Come and take it. If you can!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDB_0,And who is this?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDB_1,I am Vahl. And you are more of Ultimus' wayward minions.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_MIDB_2,"Ultimus is gone. But our new master has need of that hammer. If you stand with him, you shall fall!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_END_0,"I thank you, stranger. I see that you are a friend to Asgard, though you travel with... odd company."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_END_1,I think he means us.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_END_2,Also what appears to be two distinct gods of mischief.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_01_END_3,I will explain...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_0,"I see. You have a most worthy quest, Vahl of Asgard."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_1,"Will you lend us your aid, Beta Ray Bill?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_2,"Alas, I cannot. I am sworn to hunt down several of these red-eyed ""variants"" as you call them."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_3,"If we aid you in your quest, will you in turn aid us in ours?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_4,I would be honored to do so.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_INTRO_5,Then lead the way.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_START_0,Is this really necessary?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_START_1,It does seem like a rather superfluous deviation from our urgent agenda.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_END_0,"We need Bill. When we begin the ritual, you will be extremely vulnerable."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_END_1,You have forbidden me from recruiting your brother. With Bill and these humans we can hold the line when the time comes.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_02_END_2,"Yes, yes. Fine. Do as you will."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_INTRO_0,"Cheer up, Loki. All these variants are versions of your brother or his friends."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_INTRO_1,Shouldn't that turn that frown upside down?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_INTRO_2,"Do not speak to me, human."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_INTRO_3,I advise you to be more polite to my friend.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_MID_0,"And you, what are you anyway? You're not like anything I've come across before."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_MID_1,"I am Death, Asgardian. Perhaps you feel ill at ease because I remind you of the mortality you try so desperately to hide."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_MID_2,Did you call ME a MORTAL? The impudence!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_MID_3,"Can you two flirt later, like maybe when we're not in the middle of fighting?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_END_0,"Thanks for holding the space for me, Deathy."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_END_1,That's what friends are for.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_END_2,I admit it's fun to see one so small humble one whose ego is so big.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_END_3,Not as fun as it was to be the one doing it.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_03_END_4,Ha ha! Well spoken!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_INTRO_0,"I admit, your aid has been invaluable. Were it not for you this would have taken far longer."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_INTRO_1,We have only two more variants I hunt. One is close.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_INTRO_2,Then let's not delay.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_INTRO_3,Agreed!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_START_0,Bill why are you hunting down all these variants of Thor?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_START_1,"As fun as this is, I never thought I would grow tired of killing my brother. Yet here we are."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_START_2,"It is a sacred charge from Odin himself, Little Loki!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_START_3,"Is it, now? Curious..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_END_0,I presume you are finding these variants thanks to the hammer?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_END_1,Indeed. How did you know?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_END_2,Because I am familiar with this plan. I thought of it not long after Ultimus arrived.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_END_3,"What are you saying, trickster?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_04_END_4,"Hmm? Oh, nothing."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_INTRO_0,"Bill, are you noticing your hammer's power increase as you defeat the various variants of my idiot brother?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_INTRO_1,"Now that you mention it, it does seem to be gaining power as you describe."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_INTRO_2,"What are you thinking, Loki?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_INTRO_3,"Be prepared. When we defeat this final Thor, watch for a sudden ambush or attack. Someone has orchestrated this."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_START_0,That's a mighty fine hammer you have there. I think you'd better let me have a look at it.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_START_1,"Hammer envy, Thor?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_START_2,"Even cast across universes I cannot escape your barbed tongue, brother."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_MID_0,"Well, this is unexpected."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_MID_1,Not really. I thought of this plan months ago.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_MID_2,Oh really? You thought up a plan to get muscles-for-brains to absorb the powers of variant Mjolnirs to curry favor with the Heartless One?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_MID_3,"No, don't be stupid. I thought up a plan to get him to kill a bunch of Thor variants because it would be amusing."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_MID_4,But thanks for revealing your plan. Now be a good variant and die.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_0,"So in the end, it was another Loki that was also our foe."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_1,"Pale imitation, maybe."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_2,"Yes, certainly nothing like the real thing."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_3,"And now thanks to my brilliance, we also know who our true enemy is."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_4,"The ""Heartless One"" ?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_5,"Wait, since it was a different Loki who blabbed doesn't mean that you're also technically the one who snitched?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_BETARAYBILL_05_END_6,You are relentlessly annoying.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_0,"Right then, are you all ready?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_1,"Excuse me, who are you?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_2,"Is that... no, it can't be."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_3,Oh but of course it can.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_4,It would appear the last Loki variant has found US.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_5,"Yes, I've been watching you bumble around ever since you recruited the alligator and its pet teenager."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_6,"So you already know of our need, and our plan?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_INTRO_7,"Of course. But after all I've been through, I need to cut loose and have a little fun."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_START_0,Is anyone else extremely confused? Isn't the new character supposed to join our side?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_START_1,"Oh honey, I'm being mercurial. And mischievous. And, well, you know, woman's prerogative and all that."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_START_2,"If this is how the story unfolds, then so be it."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_0,"Hmm, let's see. How about I take the power of those 5 Mjolnir's you're carting around, and imbue it into one human."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_1,Hello!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_2,"No, please. ANYONE but him."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_3,"FIVE Mjolnir's, you say? You know what that means!"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_4,Don't say it...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_MID_5,IT'S HAMMER TIME!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_END_0,"Great job, kid... you win..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_END_1,You might say you really... nailed it.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_END_2,You'll pay for that.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_01_END_3,Oh? Try your best. I've been chased by the worst.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_INTRO_0,"Loki, cease these games."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_INTRO_1,"I'm not Loki, dear Vahl. I'm Sylvie. And no, I don't think I will."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_INTRO_2,It's time to flip the script.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_START_0,Why does everything look weird?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_START_1,"WAIT, ARE WE ON THE ENEMY SIDE?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_START_2,This is Sylvie. A variant of Loki from the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_START_3,"Sylvie can reduce the enemy speed bar, steal positive effects from enemies, and punish enemies with Speed Up. If a Mirror Image Loki is killed, she gives Bifrost allies positive Speed Bar."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_START_4,As a member of the Bifrost team she is great in Raids.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_END_0,I don't like being on the enemy side.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_END_1,How curious. All the others are completely oblivious to my enchantment.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_END_2,"How is it you're unaffected, human?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_END_3,I know a lot of stuff I'm not supposed to. I got TRON'd.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_02_END_4,I haven't the faintest idea what that means. But I like you. Let's be friends.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_0,I feel as if some peculiar magic is fading. What did you do?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_1,Just a little mischief from one God of such to another.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_2,"But I'm done for now. I had my fun, now we need to take care of something."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_3,Of what do you speak?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_4,"Our real enemies are called the ""Aphelions"", and I was brought here to help deal with one particular one."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_INTRO_5,We'll have to fight our way to him though.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_END_0,"Sylvie, you spoke of being ""brought"" here. Did you not emerge from a rift?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_END_1,No. Our backstories are similarly tragic I'm afraid. My universe was also destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_END_2,But not by some mad Kree. My reality was annihilated in an Incursion by the same group responsible for accelerating the one affecting yours.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_END_3,"I was cast into the space between spaces, and saved by a traveler who called herself Kestrel."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_03_END_4,"She said my help would be needed at a pivotal moment, and having nothing better to do in a timeless infinite void, I decided to take her up on her offer."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_0,"According to what Kestrel told me, the Aphelions are organized into 5 large groups each led by a general that answers to the big boss."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_1,"The mystic general is some guy named ""Kang"", and he's got two lieutenants. That's who we're after."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_2,And once we defeat these lieutenants you will agree to join us in our efforts?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_3,"Oh Vahl, don't you realize we're all working on the same problem?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_4,You attack the leaf. My plan pulls out the root.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_INTRO_5,"Can't get to the root if a tangle of branches are in the way, darling."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_START_0,"That's him, the ostentatious one."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_START_1,"Be careful, he's powerful."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_START_2,But he is no GOD.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_0,These foes are imbued with ancient dark magic. What human could possess such power?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_1,"One that has made a foolish deal, most likely."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_2,Then you sense it as well?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_3,"Of course, you are me, after all."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_4,Do you feel like sharing with the rest of the class?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_04_END_5,"Not yet. Let's see what the next ""lieutenant"" tells us."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_0,"Before we proceed, a word of warning. This last lieutenant..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_1,It is a variant of one who carries the Phoenix Force.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_2,"Of course, I figured you'd know given your companion."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_3,Skreee!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_4,"Well said, little one. After all we have seen, after all we have faced, this is simply another foe."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_INTRO_5,Nothing more.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_START_0,"There, do you sense it?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_START_1,Yes. There can be no doubt. It is the power of a pact.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_MID_0,You are powerful... perhaps powerful enough to stop him...
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_MID_1,Skreekaw!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_MID_2,"It was the one called Kang who sent me. But he answers to another... a man who lost his heart, and in turn his soul."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_MID_3,Seek... AHHHH... he is... in my MIND....
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_MID_4,Seek.... Strange... The Sorcerer.... Sup.... AHHHHHHHH!
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_0,And now its done. Only Kang remains between us and the one behind this.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_1,I'm not so sure. It would seem you have not had the misfortune to be acquainted with this sort of magic.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_2,Of what do you speak?
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_3,"Whoever Kang answers to, it's not the real puppet master. Just some poor fool who forged a ""pact""..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_4,...with Mephisto.
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_5,"I suspect this ""Heartless One"" is some fool wizard that made a deal with a Demon."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_6,"And now the power gained has, predictably, caused untold chaos and destruction."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_7,"That does not change the fact that if we don't stop your ""wizard"", the Incursion will destroy this reality just as mine was."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_8,"Indeed. But now we can enact the plan. With you three, each a unique Loki, we stand a chance."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_9,"Uh, question from the humans in the room. HOW?"
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_10,"Call them what you will, Fates, Norns, Weavers... they are known by many names. Always three there are, and three do they number."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_11,"Their power is, ultimately, that to know the STORY of all. To tell it, to see it."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_12,"We now have 3 Gods of Stories. And by combining their powers, we will supplant the Norns, read the Story of this universe..."
ID_DIALOG_SEC_SYLVIE_05_END_13,And change it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_0,"Vahl, tell us of the plan."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_1,"Yeah, I'm totally in suspense over here!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_2,"Very well. As I said, we will combine the powers of Loki, Teen Loki, and Sylvie to usurp the powers of the Norns."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_3,We shall temporarily be able to alter the story of the universe on a grand scale.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_4,I thought the Norns can't affect change beyond the Nine Realms?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_5,You are correct. And yet...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_6,"During the battle against Ultimus, I witnessed the All-Father attempt what we now attempt. With the Odinforce, he was able to nearly succeed."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_7,But he only had one Loki?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_8,"Yes. And so, failed."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_9,"But you have the Odinforce from your universe now, don't you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_INTRO_10,"Indeed. And as the first step, we must find the one I followed here. The one called ""Kang""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_START_0,"Oh, HELL NO. I'm not doing this again."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_START_1,"Tell us how to find Kang, and we will leave in peace."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_START_2,"You hit hard, but I'm more afraid of Kang than I am of you. Bring it!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_END_0,"Tisk tisk, Vahl. You started with the stick when you should have used the carrot."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_END_1,"Tell us how to find Kang, human. And I promise you you will never need fear him again once we are done."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_01_END_2,"You're crazy. But hey, it's your funeral."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_INTRO_0,"We're closing in on Kang. What do we do once we have him, Vahl?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_INTRO_1,"We need the device he uses to open rifts. If we can open a rift to my universe, the Vahlforce I carry will once again activate."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_INTRO_2,"Not bad, you'd have the same power as the All-Father."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_INTRO_3,"For a few crucial moments, yes."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_START_0,"Well, well. I thought I'd seen the last of you. Now I understand why my lieutenants stopped reporting in."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_START_1,"You're a motley bunch to be sure, but I've killed most of you more times than I can count."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_START_2,I have other tasks at hand. Let's make this quick.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_MID_0,This mortal is alarmingly powerful.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_MID_1,He's buffed with the pact magic just like his minions.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_MID_2,Then perhaps you'd like some help?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_MID_3,YOU?! What are you doing here!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_MID_4,Isn't it obvious? Winning.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_0,"Speak quickly, or be branded our enemy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_1,"I just saved you, and that's the thanks I get? Here, with this, you can open the portal to your universe."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_2,Why are you helping us?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_3,"Imbued as he was, I couldn't defeat him on my own. And now that he's dead, that's one less participant in the grand game."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_4,What game?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_5,"Why, the only one that truly matters: Mine."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_02_END_6,Good luck dealing with your little Incursion. You'll need it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_0,It's finally done. My universe is one step closer to being avenged.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_1,"I admit, I wasn't expecting a friendly Kang to show up and help."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_2,"Nor I. Nevertheless, we have one part of what we need."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_3,"What's next, Vahl?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_4,"We require a conduit to bridge the Norns power with your own. 3 Gods, 3 conduits."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_5,Norn Stones?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_INTRO_6,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_START_0,"The stones of our universe are scattered, but there are some on earth. Humans store one in this place, oblivious to its true nature."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_START_1,And you just left it here?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_START_2,I had planned to retrieve it eventually.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_START_3,Eventually is now. Fight.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_END_0,See? Simple. You fret too much.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_END_1,"Unlike you, I know what those are capable of. To leave one in the hands of humans knowingly? You're mad."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_END_2,You're cute when you're furious.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_03_END_3,Say that again and we shall be forced to find a fourth Loki.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_0,The remaining stones on earth aren't so easily retrieved unfortunately.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_1,Where are they?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_2,"One resides with a man who may be the most dangerous human alive. He calls himself ""Doom""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_3,The other with the only one capable of keeping him in check. Earth's so-called Sorcerer Supreme.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_4,Sorcerer Supreme... OMG Dr. Strange! THAT'S who Phoenix was trying to tell us about!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_5,"Gwen, you're a genius! She's right!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_INTRO_6,"New York it is, then."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_START_0,Hey this isn't the cool window house. What gives?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_START_1,Who are you thinking you can just teleport into the Sanctum San-- Loki?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_START_2,And... what is this? We're under attack!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_MID_0,We mean you no harm. Stop fighting.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_MID_1,You try to teleport into my Sanctum with three trickster gods and think I'm going to believe you?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_0,STOP FIGHTING!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_2,"We meant no disrespect or malice. We are seeking Asgardian artifacts called Norn Stones, and were told your leader held one."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_3,My... leader? You mean Strange? I'm the Sorcerer Supreme now. Stephen Strange vanished without a trace weeks ago.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_4,Weeks? So... right around the time the rifts started opening and the Incursion started.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_5,He must have gone to investigate. The fool. Got in over his head most likely.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_6,You're pretty rude for a kid.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_7,"I'm the oldest ""kid"" you've ever met. Give us the Norn Stone and we'll be on our way."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_8,Why should I trust any of you?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_9,"I swear on my honor, if you return the stone to us we will use it to stop this Incursion."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_04_END_10,"If you want the stones, that means you're going after Doom right? Tell you what, I'll tag along and if you're true to your word. Then we'll talk."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_INTRO_0,"Your plan is ambitious, I'll give you that. Can you really pull it off?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_INTRO_1,"The story of this universe isn't finished yet. That is what I believe, Sorcerer Wong."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_INTRO_2,"That's an odd answer. But if it means saving the world and stripping Victor von Doom of some of his more dangerous trinkets, I'm here for it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_START_0,"Ahh, right on time."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_START_1,"If you expected us, you know why we've come. Give us the stone, human."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_START_2,"Oh, but it's so useful. Let me show you."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_WAVE2_0,"Doombots, attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_WAVE3_0,Bested my machines? Try these.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_WAVE4_0,Very well. Now you face the unrestrained might of DOOM!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_0,"I'm impressed. I think maybe numbers were on our side, but still. Impressive."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_1,OMG guys we just defeated Doctor Doom! Do you know how badass that is?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_2,I'm pretty sure those were all machines or variants.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_3,"What?! Way to take the wind out of my sails, Wongie."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_4,"What matters is you got the stone he had, and I'm convinced you're not enacting some evil plot. Here's the one I have."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_5,"Thank you, Sorcerer Wong. You are an honorable ally."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_05_END_6,"Same to you, Vahl."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_0,Now comes the most dangerous part of the plan.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_1,"Together, we must fight into the heart of the breaching universes. Deep in the heart of the Incursion we will enact the ritual."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_2,"So, a long series of fights against empowered variants trying to kill us, followed by a climactic showdown?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_3,Do we have the VFX budget for any of that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_4,"I don't know what that means, but your summary is likely true."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_INTRO_5,"Into the breach, friends and allies! Let our stories be told from now until the end of days!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_START_0,They're all empowered by the same magic as Kang. Be careful.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_END_0,PRESS ONWARD! FOR ASGARD! FOR ALL THAT LIVES!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_06_END_1,SKREEEEEEE!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_START_0,Wait a minute... is that...?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_START_1,Help!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_0,"Of all the people that could have shown up, I'd never guess it would be... a trio of Lokis and you all."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_1,"What are you doing here, human?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_2,Using every last ounce of my magic to keep the Incursion from spreading.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_3,And... I found out who's behind this.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_4,Oh? We believe it's someone like yourself. An earthly wizard who's made a pact with Mephisto.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_07_END_5,"You're more right than you know. it's not someone LIKE me, it IS me. A Stephen Strange from another world."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_0,"You have some explaining to do, human. What do you mean it ""is you""?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_1,"Somewhere out there in the multiverse, a version of me lost everything he loved. When he lost his heart, he lost his mind."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_2,"He turned to dark magic, and used a forbidden tome called the Darkhold."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_3,"And then, in his grief and madness, he made a deal with something worse and lost his soul."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_4,Now in his grief he pulls his shattered reality towards others that have the one he lost.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_5,"And he uses the power of the Darkhold to enslave those that survive. You must have met them, he calls him his ""generals""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_6,But now he has a new plan. A plan to fix everything.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_7,Lead us to him. We will do the rest.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_INTRO_8,Of course...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_0,What deception is this? I see no enemy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_1,Oh? Maybe that's because...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_2,...I was here all along!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_3,"I was so lost until I saw what you were planning. I really must thank you. With the power of these three, I can rewrite my fate!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_4,"I can go back. Make everything like it was! I can FIX IT! I'll never have made that accursed pact, never have read the book!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_5,I CAN FIX IT ALL!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_6,"Foolish human. The past is set, it cannot be changed."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_7,"But the future... the future is not written yet! Now! Bill! Open the rift, start the ritual!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_START_8,"Friends, protect us until the ritual is complete!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_WAVE2_0,"To me, my generals!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_WAVE3_0,THE RITUAL IS COMPLETE. STRIKE HIM DOWN. WE CAN CHANGE THE STORY OF THIS UNIVERSE.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_0,Nooooo! The power.... I can.... I... ARRGGHHH
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_1,"Trying to get out of our little arrangement, hmm? I'm afraid that's not part of the... bargain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_2,ARRRRGGGHHHHHHAAAAAHHHHHHHH
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_3,IT IS DONE.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_4,"Meanwhile, at S.T.R.I.K.E. HQ..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_5,"Sir, I have confirmation! The Asgardians actually pulled it off!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_6,Never doubted for a second. Do you have your candidates selected?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_7,"Yes, sir. Dimensional coordinates locked in for all of them."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_8,"Excellent. Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. is a go. Godspeed, Agent Kestrel."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_9,"And what will you do, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_08_END_10,I made a promise to that Asgardian that just saved our butts. I keep my promises.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_0,One Day After the Defeat of Strange...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_1,"So that's it, then? Did we stop the Incursion?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_2,"This one, maybe. But these sorts of things don't start or stop on their own."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_3,"Indeed. Ultimus is the one truly responsible for this. As Sylvie said, this Incursion was being accelerated, but it was still coming."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_4,Does that mean there will be more Incursions?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_5,That is not for me to say.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_6,Sure would be nice if the Loki's had stuck around. Could use them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_7,I think they have much to dwell on. They saw the tapestry as none but Fates are meant to.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_8,Such an experience tends to have lasting effects.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_9,"What about you, Vahl? What's next for the ""Last Asgardian""?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_10,A promise was made. I intend to collect.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_11,And after that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_12,I've wandered alone long enough. It would be good to spend time with new friends.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_INTRO_13,Hell yeah!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_0,"I know this isn't exactly what I promised, but the Ultimus that destroyed your universe is gone."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_1,"This works. Your debt is paid, Nick Furyson."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_2,"Uh, yeah. You do know that's not my... you know what nevermind. Have fun."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_3,"Warning. Warning. Stasis suspended for Ultimus' 1316, 1317, 1318."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_4,WHO DARES-
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_START_5,I am Vahl. Vengeance is mine.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_0,I have a task for you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_1,"I am yours to command, Master."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_2,Strange has failed. But I have a new soul I wish to add to my collection.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_3,Speak the name and I will act.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_4,"No, for now... observe. I want to know everything about the one called…"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_BIFROST_09_END_5,Vahl.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_0,"Good to work with you again, Commander. I trust you remember Captain Carter and her team?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_1,Commander. Ma'am.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_2,The Asgardians have dealt a crippling blow to the enemy group known as the Aphelions and taken out a variant of Stephen Strange.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_3,"That means the work he was doing to accelerate the Incursion has stopped, but the event itself hasn't."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_4,"However, we have a plan for that. Together with Captain Carter and her team, we're going to recruit for a new initiative."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_INTRO_5,"It's called Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Everything will make sense soon enough. But for now, we need to head to New York and recruit our first member."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_START_0,"Rescue, come in. This is S.T.R.I.K.E. calling Rescue, over."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_START_1,I'm a bit busy here at the moment.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_START_2,"Commander, let's lend the lady a hand, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_MID_0,"Didn't think you could take me yourself, Pepper?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_MID_1,That's enough out of you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_0,Thanks for the assist...?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_1,"The name's Carter, Captain Carter."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_2,"The Captain here is a ""variant"" from another reality, Rescue. Much like the War Machine you just defeated."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_3,"But unlike him, she isn't one of Ultimus' leftovers."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_4,"And now that he's out of the way, I have a proposition I'd like to discuss with you."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_01_END_5,I'm listening…
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_0,"Colliding realities, Incursions, this is a lot to take in."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_1,I know. It's serious stuff. But you see now why I need your help?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_2,"I get the gravity of the situation. But it sounds more like you need Tony, not me."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_3,"In a manner of speaking, yes. I'm recruiting for a new team called P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Specific individuals from across the multiverse…"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_4,People with a certain skillset and talent. We're going to build a device to stabilize reality.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_INTRO_5,"And our first recruit is Tony Stark, or I should say, ""A"" Tony Stark."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_START_0,"Dimensional coordinates locked in. Welcome to what remains of Earth-468625, team."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_START_1,Be on the lookout for...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_START_2,More invaders? We had a deal. But it looks like your Baron needs to be taught a little lesson.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_MID_0,"Tony, stop this!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_MID_1,"Pepper? That's low. Whoever your Baron is, they should know that sending you is only going to piss me off."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_MID_2,"Stark, stop this, this isn't what you think!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_MID_3,"Yeah, heard that one before."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_0,Okay... you got me…
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_1,"We're not your enemy, Stark. We're not from this place. We're from another reality, true, but we're friends."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_2,"I'm Kestrel, and I represent an organization dedicated to defending my world from the same sort of things that happened to yours."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_3,"And if you'll just let me talk, I'll explain everything."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_4,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_02_END_5,"Tony, I don't know what happened to you or your world, but you can trust her."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_0,"Okay, start talking."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_1,"So you're the world that finally defeated Ultimus, eh? I'm glad to hear someone put him down."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_2,But that doesn't explain what you want with me.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_3,After we defeated Ultimus we started combing through his data in his flagship. We learned a lot.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_4,"His tech formed the basis for my suit, among other things. And we also uncovered designs for something called the Equilibrium Cascade."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_5,A device that can stabilize any universe its activated in and even halt Incursions.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_INTRO_6,And we need your help to build it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_START_0,"And this ""Equilibrium Cascade"" can save your reality? What about mine? I'm not from this place either, you know."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_START_1,"One minute Thanos is dropping a moon on me, and the next thing I know I'm here fighting for my life in the Baron Wars."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_START_2,"Your reality was already colliding with another. But if you help me, I'll help you find your world again. I promise."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_START_3,"Sister, you got yourself a deal."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_END_0,"Glad to have you onboard, Iron Man."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_END_1,"You know, you look like someone my dad had a picture of in his office, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_END_2,"In my world, Howard is a good friend. I'm glad to see his son keeps his spirit alive."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_END_3,Yeah.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_03_END_4,Something like that.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_0,All three of the recruits we're looking for are somewhere in this broken amalgamated reality.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_1,"According to scans, the next one isn't too far now."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_2,Why don't we just use your fancy suit to go there directly?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_3,"Whatever this fractured reality is, my suit can only operate in pockets of it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_4,It's like a soup of hundreds of different realities all merged together. I can't lock onto any specific energy when immersed in it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_INTRO_5,This just keeps getting better.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_START_0,"Is this what will happen to our world, Kestrel?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_START_1,"I don't know. Ultimus left a lot of destruction in his wake. In universes where he couldn't win, he would deploy his ultimate weapon."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_START_2,"It was called the ""Entropy Cascade"" and it would do the opposite of what we're trying to do."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_START_3,It would consume all the energy in the universe tearing holes in the fabric of reality. Nothing could survive.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_START_4,"But sometimes, things would fall through those tears first. It seems like this is where they'd end up."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_END_0,So this place is just the remnants of countless universes Ultimus destroyed?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_END_1,Basically.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_END_2,Can we do anything for them?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_04_END_3,"Right now we need to stay focused on our reality, Captain. After that we can turn our attention elsewhere."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_INTRO_0,"Our next recruit is nearby. He's called ""Darkhawk""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_INTRO_1,"He operates, or IS an android of Shi'ar origin that can manipulate mystical energy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_INTRO_2,"This ability is key to the goals of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and operating the Equilibrium Cascade, once we build it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_INTRO_3,Is it a bird shaped android?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_INTRO_4,Only one way to find out.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_START_0,"Time's up, Darkhawk. Where's the amulet? The Baron's run out of patience."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_START_1,What a pity.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_START_2,Looks like you could use a hand.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_MID_0,And you are?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_MID_1,"Helping you, so maybe ask questions later?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_MID_2,Fair enough!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_0,"Thanks for the help, who are you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_1,"I'm Kestrel, this is Captain Carter and her team. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_2,The name's Iron Man.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_3,I'm Rescue.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_4,"We're here to make you an offer, Mr...?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_05_END_5,Darkhawk will do for now.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_INTRO_0,And you want ME to join this little team of yours?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_INTRO_1,"Precisely. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_INTRO_2,"Why, exactly?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_INTRO_3,The Equilibrium Cascade needs a unique kind of power source. That's all I can say for now.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_INTRO_4,"I see... I think I know what you're alluding to, but this isn't a safe place to talk. I'll tag along for now. Where to?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_0,Why do you keep looking at me like that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_1,"You don't know me, do you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_2,Should I?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_3,"Where I'm from, we have a history. I find it hard to believe you work on the side of good in your world."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_4,"[THIS ONE IS ANNOYING, FLASH. CAN I EAT HIM? I HAVE NEVER EATEN ANDROID.]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_5,No! No eating!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_6,What was that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_START_7,"Uh, nothing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_0,"The parasite speaks in your mind, doesn't it?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_1,"[I AM HUNGRY, FLASH. FIND FOOD. OOH, IS THAT A CAT? I LOVE CAT! MOVE CLOSER I WANT TO EAT THE CAT.]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_2,"Uh, you could say that."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_3,"[FLASH, I DEMAND YOU MOVE CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONSUME THAT CAT.]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_4,What is it saying?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_5,[I WANT CAT. I WANT CAT NOW!]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_6,"He, uh, likes cats."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_06_END_7,That's... unexpected.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_INTRO_0,We need to be careful here. This area is the territory of a Baron I've crossed before...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_INTRO_1,Well what do we have here? Looks like this time the bounty came to me.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_START_0,We're just passing through.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_START_1,"You know the rules, bub. You cross the Baron, you get the claws."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_START_2,Move or be moved.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_START_3,"Let's dance, lady."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_MID_0,"C'mon, boys. We got our orders."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_MID_1,"How many versions of this guy does this ""Baron"" employ?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_MID_2,Too many!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_END_0,They're... regenerating?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_07_END_1,That's kind of his thing. Move fast. He won't chase us outside his territory.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_INTRO_0,"Whose the final recruit, Kestrel?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_INTRO_1,"She goes by ""Ironheart"". A genius and someone who knows vibranium like almost nobody else."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_INTRO_2,Riri? I know her in our world. Is this one different?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_INTRO_3,"Yes. This one has skills and knowledge ours doesn't. In her reality, Tony Stark and Princess Shuri died."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_INTRO_4,"This Riri Williams stepped up and helped fight Ultimus, forcing him to destroy her universe. She has... unique skills we need."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_START_0,Ms. Williams? My name is --
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_START_1,"Kestrel. Yeah, I know. Took you long enough! Get ready. I set the beacon like five minutes ago, they'll be here any second."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_START_2,What?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_START_3,TARGET IDENTIFIED. ENGAGE.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_0,I'm confused. Do you mind filling us in?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_1,"Yeah, I knew you were coming. I got this entire region under observation."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_2,Heard everything you've been saying too.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_3,Does that mean you'll help us?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_4,"Why do you think I'm putting up a flare for these tin cans? You wanna leave this place, you're going to need some vibranium."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_08_END_5,"Well, more like I'M gonna need some. But you can help collect."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_0,"So, here's the deal. You want to use your suit to leave, and don't want to backtrack to where you first appeared, right?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_1,"That would be nice, yes."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_2,"Okay, so we need vibranium; a lot of it. I can use it to, like you said, stir the soup a bit. Bring the flavor to the top for a bit."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_3,"And in this analogy, flavor is?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_4,"Temporary Quantum Coherence leading to Momentary Dimensional Stability. Try to keep up, girl."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_INTRO_5,Right.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_MID_0,"So, we're collecting scraps of vibranium from the Ultron bots to build a Quantum Resonator?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_MID_1,Nice to see at least one of y'all has a working brain. Guess I shouldn't be surprised it's you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_MID_2,Nice kid.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_END_0,You know this would just go a lot faster if we took out the big kahuna himself. His whole body is made out of vibranium.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_END_1,"What do you think we're doing, genius? He ain't going to come by himself unless we're a threat he has to deal with personally."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_END_2,We don't qualify as a threat?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_09_END_3,"You really don't know the first thing about this place, do you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_0,A few more bots scrapped and the big bot himself will be coming. Get ready.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_1,And then what?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_2,We return to my world and the real work starts.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_3,"The ""Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S."" you were talking about?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_4,That's the one.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_INTRO_5,You S.H.I.E.L.D. types sure do love your acronyms.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_START_0,THREAT LEVEL NINE TARGETS LOCATED. INITIATE PROTOCOL TAU.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_MID_0,THREAT LEVEL UPGRADED TO LEVEL 10. INITIATE OMEGA PROTOCOL.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_MID_1,This is it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_MID_2,"Ahh, I was wondering who was playing with my toys. Riri Williams... and do my eyes deceive me?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_MID_3,"Another Tony Stark? My, how I do love ending you. I never tire of it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_MID_4,"Be careful what you wish for, Ultron. Where I come from, you're the one on my bookshelf."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_0,"Whew, worked up a sweat there. Give me an hour and I'll be ready. You'll have two or three minutes to work your suit."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_1,"That's enough time, right?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_2,Plenty.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_3,Great.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_4,I can't believe we'll be free of this place.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_5,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS_10_END_6,"Me too. Everyone, welcome to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_0,"Commander Kestrel, I see you've got your team assembled. Good work."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_1,"Thank you, sir."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_2,"Everyone, welcome to the Potential Energy Group/Alternate Sources United States, or P.E.G.A.S.U.S."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_3,"Although just between us, those last two may as well stand for ""Ultimus Sourced"". I'll let our lead scientist fill you in."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_4,"Greetings, team. I'll get right to the point, our universe is beginning to fall apart thanks to Ultimus, Doctor Doom, the Incursion, etc."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_5,"But in digging through the data recovered from Ultimus, we know a way to fix it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_6,"The ""Equilibrium Cascade""?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_INTRO_7,Right you are. Commander Kestrel has the details. Good luck.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_START_0,So we're back in the fractured world?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_START_1,Yes. Mister Fantastic is building the device according to the plans we recovered from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_START_2,"The thing is, it needs a unique kind of power source. And the only place we know to find it... is here."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_START_3,"I knew it. You're after ""it"", aren't you? The energy from destroyed universes!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_START_4,"It has a lot of names, but we call it ""Potential"" energy. It's what the P in P.E.G.A.S.U.S. stands for."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_MID_0,See that? The enemies we defeat here are suffused with micro amounts of Potential Energy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_MID_1,"Darkhawk, we need you to capture it. And Stark, you and Ms. Williams will contain it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_END_0,"I don't get it, why do you need us? Why not recruit your own Iron Man and Ironheart?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_END_1,"I thought you were smart, genius. They need us because we have Potential Energy inside us. We're attractors."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_01_END_2,"Like the two poles of a magnet. Darkhawk keeps it from floating away, and we contain it so it can be stored."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_0,"So we're just going to go around fighting, randomly collecting energy to power this device?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_1,"Basically. And once we have enough, we stabilize our reality."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_2,And after that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_3,"I promised you I'd help you all return to your universes. If that's what you want, I'll do it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_4,And if we want to build one of these Equilibrium Cascade machines to fix our realities too?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_INTRO_5,That's... complicated.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_START_0,"What do you mean ""complicated""?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_START_1,"The device is difficult to build, I'm not at liberty to explain how or why. But suffice to say, there can only be one and it has to be left on."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_START_2,That's interesting.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_END_0,"What're you thinking, kid?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_END_1,"Watch who you call kid, old man."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_END_2,Fair enough. Question stands.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_02_END_3,"I've got an idea or two, I'll let you know when I figure it out."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_INTRO_0,"P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Leader calling S.T.R.I.K.E. Actual. Fury, you there? Over."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_INTRO_1,"Your signal isn't coming in great, Commander. What do you need?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_INTRO_2,"Sir, I need permission to disclose the nature of the device to the team. They're asking questions."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_INTRO_3,Permission denied. Collect the energy and get out of that broken dimension before you attract the wrong kind of attention.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_INTRO_4,"Yes, sir."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_START_0,I am uncomfortable with my role in this team. The masters of this world hunted me to do this for them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_START_1,"If there was any other way, Darkhawk, BELIEVE me we'd take it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_START_2,But time isn't on our side.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_END_0,I don't trust our new allies. They're holding back.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_END_1,You don't say?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_03_END_2,I've got it worked out. Let's confront her. Follow my lead.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_INTRO_0,"Kestrel, we need to talk."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_INTRO_1,About?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_INTRO_2,Whatever you're not telling us about the Cascade device.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_INTRO_3,I've told you everything I'm authorized to say.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_INTRO_4,That's not good enough.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_START_0,"""Potential Energy"" is dangerous! You don't know the fire you're playing with!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_START_1,"Believe me, if there was another choice..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_START_2,Halt.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_START_3,You have been siphoning energy that is the rightful property of my master. You will surrender and relinquish immediately.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_START_4,To be continued!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_MID_0,"Enough, I will deal with you myself!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_END_0,"We need to leave the area. If his master is who I think it is, this place isn't safe."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_END_1,"No, we resolve this NOW!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_END_2,I...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_END_3,"You expect us to trust YOU, when you won't trust US?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_04_END_4,"Okay, okay, let's find someplace safe to talk and I'll tell you everything."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_0,"Are you ready to tell us what's really going on, Kestrel?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_1,"You all need to understand I'm not authorized to tell you this, so what I'm about to say doesn't leave this conversation."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_2,"As you know, Ultimus conquered or destroyed countless realities. And you may know he had an ultimate weapon called the ""Entropy Cascade""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_3,"You've mentioned it before, yeah. It's interesting both his weapon and your miracle machine are some sort of ""cascade""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_4,"It's not a coincidence, is it, Kestrel?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_5,No. They are the same machine. Think of it like a motor that has forward and reverse. That is why I couldn't tell you the truth.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_INTRO_6,"The very device that can save my universe, and all of yours, is the same device that if misused could destroy everything."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_START_0,"So you didn't build the device, did you? Your Reed Richards found it when your universe defeated Ultimus?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_START_1,"Yes. And he deduced, based on data recovered from Ultimus' database, that it could work in reverse to stop Incursions."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_START_2,"But it needs Potential Energy to function, and if it can't extract it from the universe its in, it has to come from somewhere."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_START_3,And so you decided to take it from this broken conglomeration of worlds?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_START_4,More or less.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_0,But that's not all. Our estimates say it will take YEARS of running the device before our universe can be stabilized.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_1,My orders were to keep this from you because we feared if you knew the timeline we were working under you'd refuse to help.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_2,Your fear is valid. But you forgot something important.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_3,"We are HEROES. Saving life, any life, especially a universe's worth -- that matters. That is worth doing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_4,"I don't like that you lied to us, but you told the truth when it mattered. And your universe is filled with innocents worth saving."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_5,So I will help save them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_6,Me too.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_7,"Yeah, same here."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_8,"And AFTER that, we'll see how we can save our universes. Deal?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_05_END_9,You've got my word.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_INTRO_0,"So, now that we know the real stakes, I think we should stop with the small fries and go after some larger sources of energy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_INTRO_1,"What's going through your head, Tony?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_INTRO_2,The warlords who control this world hoard the energy we need. They've got stockpiles of the stuff.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_INTRO_3,"So I say, who's up for a heist?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_0,A heist sounds dangerous when we're trying to fly under the radar with our operation here.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_1,"Sure, but if we can get a large amount of Potential Energy we can cut the time you need to run the gizmo, right?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_2,Maybe? I don't know. The device was created by Celestials in Ultimus' home universe. I don't know if more gas increases the speed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_3,"Frankly, only Richards knows anything about it beyond what I've told you. It's too dangerous to let ANY data about it get out."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_4,I still think going after the motherload is a better use of our time.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_06_END_5,I'm willing to give it a try. You all know this world better than I do.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_0,"So who we hittin', Stark?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_1,We're not far from Goblinville.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_2,I like it. Hawk?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_3,"Goblin consolidated the forces of A.I.M. from several worlds under his banner. So his forces are numerous, but manageable."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_4,His enforcers will be a problem though.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_5,We can take 'em.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_INTRO_6,Sounds like we have a plan forming. Let's head out.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_START_0,Who're the enforcers you guys mentioned?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_START_1,Goblin has a device that lets him control symbiotes. He's got a dozen or so of them I think.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_START_2,Wonderful.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_END_0,"So, what, we face off against a dozen symbiote powered enemies? How's that going to work?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_07_END_1,"We split 'em up. Shake the right tree, deal with what falls out. Rinse, repeat."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_0,"Go over the plan one last time, Stark. I want a clear picture of the risk we're taking."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_1,Sure. Goblin keeps his enforcers in two groups patrolling his territory. We take them out then move on Goblin's base before they can react.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_2,"Then after we take down Goblin, we permanently borrow his Potential Energy reserves and retreat back to your reality."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_3,"And the rest of you, how feasible does this plan sound? You're familiar with this world, I'm relying on your assessment here."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_4,"Risky, but doable."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_5,We got this.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_INTRO_6,Okay. Mission approved. Let's get started.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_START_0,We're under attack!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_WAVE2_0,Call for backup!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_WAVE3_0,YOU WORTHLESS MINIONS! YOU CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH 5 ENEMIES?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_WAVE3_1,I think the talking space slime is mad.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_08_END_0,One group of sentient slime parasites down. One to go.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_START_0,"Well, well, well, what do we have here? Thought you'd catch us by surprise, Iron Idiots?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_START_1,Attack!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_0,They were waiting for us.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_1,Way to be captain obvious.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_2,"Goblin must be trackin' us. Big and buff or not, he IS an OSBORN."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_3,You know what that means. We walkin' into his base is going to be a trap.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_4,Is it really a trap if you know it's a trap?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_09_END_5,"Stark, for someone so smart sometimes you're real dumb."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_INTRO_0,So any guesses what the trap will be?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_INTRO_1,"Let's speculate less, and focus more on the goal. IF it's a trap, we beat it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_INTRO_2,"And whatever happens, we take down this Goblin and get what we came here for. Right, team?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_INTRO_3,"You need to work on your motivational speeches a little more. But yeah, what the hell. Let's spring this trap."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_START_0,"Welcome, fools! You've walked right into my trap!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_START_1,Called it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_START_2,"You may have bested my symbiotes, but I have a NEW and IMPROVED control device. Say hello to my newest enforcer..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_START_3,HULK SMASH!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_START_4,"Oh, great. He has a Hulk."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_MID_0,"Is that all you got, Goblin? I thought you were supposed to be some kind of warlord?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_MID_1,"That's BARON OSBORN to you, metal moron!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_MID_2,"You want the Goblin? FINE, YOU GET THE GOBLIN!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_0,"Did he really shout ""you get the goblin"" at us? What kind of weird-ass world did this guy come from?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_1,"He wasn't technically wrong, we did ""get the goblin""... it's just we then kicked his ass."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_2,"Tony, can we focus for a second here? Wasn't this supposed to be a heist?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_3,"Right you are, Not My Pepper. Ms. Williams?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_4,On it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_5,"Good job, everyone. Ironheart, activate that stabilizer so we can get out of there. We've got more energy than we'd planned to get in a year."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_6,Let's see what Richards can do with it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_7,THE NEXT DAY
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_8,"Great work, Commander Kestrel and S.T.R.I.K.E. Commander. Richards says we'll still need a lot more energy, but a few more ops like that one and we'll be in a good way."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_9,"Thank you, sir. But what about my team? They know the truth."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_10,Nothing we can do about that now except trust that they really are the heroes they say they are.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_11,"If you'll forgive me, sir, that doesn't sound like you. You wouldn't let me go out there without mental blocks from Xavier preventing me from being read."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_12,"And neither will they, Commander. Trust... But not too much. I'm a spy, not a fool."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_13,"As for now, the Incursion is halted. This crisis is over."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_PEGASUS2_10_END_14,"And once again, I, and the world, are in your debt, S.T.R.I.K.E. Commander. Someday I hope I can repay it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_0,"Ant-Man, S.T.R.I.K.E. needs your help."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_1,"Wow, me? Seriously? What do you need me to steal?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_2,Nothing. We need a different set of skills this time around.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_3,Deadpool is storming a facility that houses the corrupted Techno Virus. We need you to go in and disable the distribution device.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_4,"Have you asked Hope to help on this one? You know, to make sure I don't screw things up this time?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_5,The Wasp is off on a different operation with Black Widow. You're on your own this time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_6,"Alright, Scott... You can DO this..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_7,"Okay, listen up. This facility is controlled by a corrupted Vision."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_8,We need you to get in and disable the security grid so we can sneak your support team in.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_9,"And Lang, try not to accidentally go Giant-Man on us while in transit."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_10,Last time your enormous butt crushed my favorite laptop.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_INTRO_11,"Yeah, that was an unfortunate mishap. Sorry."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_0,"Okay, going tiny to sneak in went smoothly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_1,This should be a piece of cake as long as I can evade the guards.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_2," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_3,"Good plan, Scott. Good plan."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_4,USE ANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ABILITY BLOCK</color> AN ENEMY.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_START_5,USE HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>SLOW</color> ALL OPPONENTS AT ONCE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_END_0,"I've disabled the security grid. Team is a go to infiltrate the... uh, facility, post haste... now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_01_END_1,Just... Never mind. You get what I'm saying.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_0,The Techno Virus distribution device is just up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_1,How do you know? Seems kind of weird that an all-powerful A.I. like Vision would just leave that kind of info sitting around.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_2,"It took me weeks of analyzing intel, combing through building blueprints, disassembling stolen tech, and interrogating captured Kree."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_INTRO_3,Well... Okay then. Good on you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_0,"Alright, you guys, I'm just here for the distribution device. I don't want to fight you if I don't have to."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_1,You have to fight us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_2,It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_START_3,"Fine. But for the record, I asked."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_0,Deadpool is engaging Vision in the processing center.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_1,"PARRY, DODGE, RIPOSTE!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_02_END_2,Time to go disable the device. Easy peasy.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_0,Looks like all my favorite heroes are guarding the device up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_1,And I'm going to have to beat them all up. This sucks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_2,"Ant-Man, we've got an incoming transmission from Wasp."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_INTRO_3,I'll get it later. We have important work to do.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_START_0,"Alright, team, listen up."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_START_1,"These guys are all my idols, so... I might need some help taking them out. Appreciate the assist."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_0,That fight's gonna be a tough one to erase from my memory...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_1,"Lang, the device."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_2,Oh. Right. On it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_3,Right after I take a peak inside that shiny-looking vault over there... \nCan't pass THAT up...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_4,Huh. It's just an orb chamber. But a REALLY fancy-looking one...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_03_END_5,Woah.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_0,"Distribution device disabled. You're good to go, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_1,"Thanks, Ant-Man! By the way, REALLY digging that suit of yours."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_2,SMOKE BOMB!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_3," --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_4,"Did he just shout ""Smoke bomb?"""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_5,"Lang, I've finished scanning the orb chamber you found inside that vault."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_6,It's unlike anything we've seen before. This chamber is capable of storing incredible amounts of energy inside a single orb.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_7,"See, THIS is why I steal stuff. What's the plan?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_8,Similar energy readings were recently found at an abandoned H.A.M.M.E.R. warehouse.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_9,I'm sending a team in. You want in?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_10,In like Flynn.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_11,Who's Flynn?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_INTRO_12,Never mind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_START_0,"It's okay to beat up these S.H.I.E.L.D. guys since they're corrupted, right? Still feels wrong..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_04_END_0,The energy trail leads inside. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_INTRO_0,Looks like there's a crate of orbs in here that match what we're looking for.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_INTRO_1,"I'm guessing there are a bunch of corrupted jerks guarding it, too? Game time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_0,These orbs are the property of the one true Vision. Leave now or feel the wrath of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_1,"Wait, corrupted Vision escaped?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_START_2,"See, what'd I say? Jerks."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_0,That's the last of them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_1,"Lang, the readings for this orb are off the charts."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_2,We need to bring this orb back to the Helicarrier for further analysis.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_05_END_3,Bring a mysterious super-charged orb back onto our flying aircraft carrier. Sounds safe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_0,"Agent Johnson, I just attempted to perform a cursory scan of the orb."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_1,But there's some sort of stasis field blocking my scanners.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_2,Too bad I can't shrink a whole squad into the orb to investigate from the inside.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_3,Actually... that might now be possible.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_4,"After pooling our resources together for S.T.R.I.K.E., Hank Pym recently made a breakthrough."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_5,We can now create a force field and safely shrink everything inside.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_6,So let me get this straight.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_7,"Hank made some new tech that would greatly enhance our ability to work with Pym Particles, and he didn't tell me about it?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_8,Yep.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_9,That makes sense.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_10,"So now, all we have to do is disrupt a small section of the stasis field..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_11,"And then, using new experimental Pym tech, shrink us as a team inside the gap."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_12,What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_13," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INTRO_14,"Maybe if I STOPPED talking, bad guys would stop showing up right afterwards."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_0,Surrender now and you will have the honor to join the ranks of the one true Vision's enlightened sect.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_1,"Is that an evil cult? That sounds like an evil cult. NO, THANK YOU."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_START_2,Your window for shrinking inside that orb will be limited. Cover me while I prepare the temporary disruption.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_1_0,Stasis disrupter powering up...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_2_0,Kinetic dampers activated. Almost there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_3_0,Field disruption point acquired. Preparing for rapid reduction activation...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_FAIL_0,Our operator is down. No way inside that orb now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_0,Field disruption is stable. Go now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_1,Let's do this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_06_END_2,"Lang, Bucky and I are with you. \nTime to get small!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_INTRO_0,"Huh, this is interesting... Looks like a giant, well, tiny, megastructure inside this orb."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_INTRO_1,I think I can see some kind of access door down there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_0,What. Is. This?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_1,Prepare for conversion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_2,There's a tiny jungle in here. With tiny cranes. And even tiny corrupted Hydra forces.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_START_3,Of course there are.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_0,"Lang, what the heck are we even LOOKING at in here?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_1,"Now, I could be wrong, I'm just an electrical engineer..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_2,But I THINK we're on some sort of tiny version of... Earth?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_3,Inside some kind of a planetary Dyson Sphere? It's got an artificial sun in here and everything.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_07_END_4,Sure. Still not the strangest place I've been.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_0,"My scans have confirmed this definitely resembles our Earth, just a lot... smaller?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_1,What about that fleet of Kree warships off in the distance over there?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_2,It looks like Ultimus is planning some sort of tiny invasion from here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_3,"Let's head back outside, grow to normal size, tell S.T.R.I.K.E., maybe then chuck this thing into the sun..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_INTRO_4," ...after we fight this tiny Thanos and his tiny daughters. Of course."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_0,"You may have found this planet, but you will never leave it alive."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_1,We will make sure of that. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_START_2,Shouldn't you be off looking for an itty bitty infinity gauntlet? Leave us out of this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_0,"Okay, let's get the heck off of this rock."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_1,Can't happen fast enough...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_2,"Initiating growth sequence, stand by..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_3,"Quake, you will not believe what we found inside this thing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_08_END_4,"Lang, not now! We are under attack. Get back up here and help us!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_0,What's going on? Who's attacking us!?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_1,Who do you think? That corrupted Vision has launched a full-on assault on the Helicarrier.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_2,"Hey Tiny Dude, get your squad out here and ready to fight."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_3,"Yes sir, Hawkeye, sir. Right away, sir!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_4,"Stop saying, ""sir."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_INTRO_5,"Yes, sir. I mean, sorry, sir. Sorry."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_0,"Oh man, that orb was crazy! There's a tiny Earth inside there. A tiny Earth!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_1,"Focus, Lang. One full-blown crisis at a time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_START_2,Fair enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_0,So that mega orb has a tiny planet inside. And there's a tiny Kree invasion!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_1,That structure simulates sunlight and is suspending the entire planet somehow and...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_2," --Look that's great and all, but we have a major problem."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_3,Indeed. Disrupting the stasis field has made the orb unstable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_4,It's only a matter of time before the orb explodes in a massive supernova. Quite fascinating!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_5,A regular massive supernova or a tiny massive supernova?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_6,"Never mind, that sounds bad regardless."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_7,"Yep. This is beyond our expertise, Lang. We need Hope."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_8,Time to give her a call. Now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_9,THAT sounds like fun...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_10,"Hey Hope, Scott here. Man oh man have I got a story for you..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_11,What did you screw up this time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_12,"Can you help us figure out how to prevent a tiny version of Earth from exploding? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_13," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ANTMAN_09_END_14,I'm on my way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_0,"Wasp, any luck tracking down the Hydra team that stole the cache of Pym tech from your company's facilities?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_1,I managed to trace the energy signature of the tech to a facility in the heart of the city.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_2,We can't let that tech fall into Hydra hands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_INTRO_3,I'll do some light recon. Be ready to bring in the cavalry when I give you the go-ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_0,Huh. Wasn't expecting to see a bunch of corrupted Scott Langs working as Hydra lackeys.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_1,"Yeah, well joke's on you, lady. We're the Ant-Men, and we're here to fumigate you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_2,Okay. Now I can officially confirm that even the corrupted versions of you are dorks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_3,USE WASP'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>STUN</color> A TARGET WHEN CHARGED.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_START_4,"USE HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ATTACK ALL</color>, EVEN <color=#fff568>STEALTHED</color> TARGETS."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_END_0,That was a lot more fun than it should have been. Time to see what Hydra is doing here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_01_END_1,"But first, I should call Scott and tell him about this nonsense..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_INTRO_0,"Entrance is secured. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_INTRO_1,Confirmed. Get ready to move in.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_START_0,"Squad, looks like you got here just in time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_START_1,Time is the LAST thing you've got.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_0,Analysis indicates this facility was being used to construct an orb chamber.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_1,An orb chamber harnessing Pym Particles? No wonder they had such a tough squad guarding it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_02_END_2,Not tough enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_0,Energy signatures are spiking in the processing sector up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_1,Then it's a good thing we're here to put a stop to this operation.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_2,I'm seeing signs that Wakandan tech is being used here. That combined with Pym tech...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_INTRO_3,Will prove to be your end.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_START_0,Pym's technology is truly a marvel. When combined with my people's technology --
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_START_1,It gives me twice as many reasons to stop you from using it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_0,What's so important about the orbs that can be made in this chamber?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_1,Imagine being able to store the energy of a star or a planet in a single orb.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_2,Or having a Kree Noble unleash a massive space fleet from the palm of her hands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_3,Let's just hope they haven't made any orbs with one of these things yet.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_4,I've got a call coming in from Scott. One sec.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_5,"Hey Hope, Scott here. Man oh man have I got a story for you..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_03_END_6,What did you screw up this time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_0,So let me get this straight...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_1,"You found a mysterious orb, went inside and found a tiny Earth, and now it's going to explode."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_2,"In a nutshell, yeah. Well, an orb. You get the idea."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_3,I was telling these guys that we should just fire it at the sun and be done with it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_4,"And, what, just incinerate the billions of tiny people in the process?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_5,"Oh, right. Yeah, that's a terrible plan. Maybe you should be coming up with the plans."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_6,We'll focus our resources on further analyzing the origin of the orb's contents.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_7,"I'll track down corrupted Vision's ship, see if we can find any information on where this micro-planet came from."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_8,"And keep an eye on Ant-Man while I'm at it. You know, make sure he doesn't accidentally set off any other super bombs."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_INTRO_9,"Nice. That's... Yeah, that's fair."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_0,So how are we going to find corrupted Vision's ship?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_1,I just sent out a distress call to corrupted forces asking for assistance from his team.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_2,Working with you is SO much easier than working alone.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_3,<color=#fff568>ANT-MAN</color> AND <color=#fff568>WASP</color>\nARE VERY EFFECTIVE <color=#fff568>TOGETHER</color> IN COMBAT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_4,ANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color>\nGIVES THEM BOTH A <color=#fff568>POSITIVE EFFECT</color> FROM THE TARGET.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_START_5,"WHEN BRINGING <color=#fff568>BOTH HEROES</color> INTO A FIGHT,\nANT-MAN'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> IS MUCH STRONGER."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_END_0,"Now that we took them out, we can take their shuttle and use autopilot to return to Vision's ship."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_04_END_1,You make this look so easy! It never goes this smooth for me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_0,"Further analysis of the mini-Earth shows that it is from another fallen dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_1,Ultimus has found a way to shrink the entire planet using Pym tech.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_2,So if we return the orb to its dimension and find a way to reverse the process...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_3,We could save the planet before it becomes too unstable and explodes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_4,"But these mini-guys are bad guys, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_5,"They're not bad, Scott. Just corrupted by Ultimus. It's the right thing to do."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_6,That doesn't come naturally to me. But I promised I would try harder so...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_7,Let's do it. As long as I get to change my name to Captain Mini-Planet.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_8,No.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_INTRO_9,Fine.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_0,Be on the lookout for all kinds of strange experiments Vision may have been working on.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_1,I... AM... ULTIMUS...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_2," ..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_3,"Okay, obviously this Groot has been genetically modified so it can speak in a way that we can understand more easily."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_4,So that DID just happen? I'm not losing my mind after all?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_START_5,"You're a lot of things, Scott, but you're not crazy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_MID_0,"You're Ant Person and The Wasp, right? Yeah, Vision wants you, like, 200% more dead."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_MID_1,Here I go killin' again!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_0,Well that was a fun dumpster fire to deal with. What's next?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_1,A dozen 60-foot tall Rocket Raccoons?\nA horde of A.I.M. minions shooting tiny A.I.M. minions out of their mouths?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_2,What?! Where?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_05_END_3,Just a hypothetical. Jumpy much?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_0,The vessel's command center is up ahead. Vision is bound to be in there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_1,"If Deadpool and Cable couldn't finish him off, how are we gonna beat him?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_2,For starters? We can make ourselves small enough to go inside one of his nanites and corrupt it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_3,Thereby starting a chain reaction which will make him de-materialize! Good idea.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_4,The odds of executing such a plan are far from probable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_INTRO_5,But I certainly welcome the challenge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_0,What is it you hope to accomplish by coming here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_1,Your little experiment with Pym tech has made this whole planet unstable. We're setting it right.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_2,Ultimus will not allow it. This experiment is too valuable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_3,"Oh yeah? Well we're gonna blow up all your research, too. So there!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_START_4,"Next time let's not telegraph our plans to the bad guys, okay, Scott?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_0,"Vision is finished, finally.\nAnd we located the dimensional rift where this planet comes from."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_1,The rift is in China.\nDeploying a team now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_2,Can we stop at that place with all the pandas on our way? I've always wanted to hug a panda.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_3,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_4,Right. Maybe AFTER we send mini-Earth back to its home and reverse the process.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_06_END_5,Then pandas.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_INTRO_0,We need to send the orb through the rift and reverse the process. This orb is de-stabilizating fast.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_INTRO_1,"Yep, and all we gotta do is beat the crap out of all those ninjas guarding the portal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_START_0,We will protect this portal with our lives.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_START_1,Bummer.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_END_0,"Okay, the path is clear."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_07_END_1,Right behind you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_0,It's too bad we can't take anything with us from tiny Earth before we send it home.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_1,Like a keepsake?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_2,"Yeah, like an Eiffel Tower key chain that is the ACTUAL Eiffel Tower. Something like that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_3,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_INTRO_4,Right. Do the right thing. No stealing of national monuments.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_0,The Hand of Ultimus will never let you near his most prized dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_1,"Ant-Man and The Wasp disagree. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_2,"Are we going with ""Ant-Man and Wasp"" or ""Wasp and Ant-Man?"" And do you prefer ""The Wasp"" or just ""Wasp?"""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_START_3,"Scott, shut up and fight."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_0,"Hope, you need to hurry. That thing is going to explode in a matter of minutes."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_1,Vision's team set up a lab in here surrounding the portal. This is our only chance to do this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_08_END_2,Better make it count.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_0,"Oh, great. YOU again."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_1,I was about to say the same thing about you. Your attempts to reach this portal will prove futile.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_2,Not if I have anything to say about it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_3,"This is going to be even more fun than beating up a dozen pathetic versions of you, Scott."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INTRO_4,"Wait, what?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_START_0,"As long as we take out the last of Vision's scientists, we can reverse the process and save the micro-Earth."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_START_1,"I was going with ""mini-Earth"" but ""micro-Earth"" works, too."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_0,Evil Wasp is trying to force the portal closed before we can get to it!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_1,"Take out those operators, and we still have a fighting chance."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_1_2,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_2_0,We need to focus on those operators. No time to waste.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_3_0,"If that portal closes, we're all toast. That means no pandas, no more tiny people, no more us!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_FAIL_0,"The portal's closed! And the orb, it's about to --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_0,"Quake, quick! Initiate the unlock sequence on the orb. I've got it on the other side of the portal!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_1,Stasis field disabling in 3... 2... 1...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_2,Stasis field disabled. The shrinking process is reverting...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_3,Confirmed. The planet formerly known as micro-Earth is stable and back to its normal size.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_4,Roger that.\nClosing the portal off for good.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_5,"Hey Hope, you were right. Doing the right thing DOES feel good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_6,"Maybe there's hope for you yet, Scott."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_7,Hold on. What's that in your hand?\nIs that the Eiffel Tower?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_WASP_09_END_8,No. I mean... maybe? Fine. Yes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_0,"Hey, Commander! Groot's gone missing. I'm rounding up a search party. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_1,I need to grab some S.T.R.I.K.E. guys for backup. Thanks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_2,"Last place he was seen was some backwater Ravager planet. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_INTRO_3,I'm going to start there by roughing up some of the locals.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_START_0,ROCKET'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color>\n HITS A TARGET AND <color=#fff568>ALL ADJACENT TARGETS</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_START_1,USE HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color>\nTO <color=#fff568>ATTACK ALL</color> FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_0,"Hey, Ravager! WHERE'S GROOT?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_1,Your tree friend passed through here a while ago. Sounded like he was trying to make himself scarce.\nAnd fast.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_2,Then some crazy robot charged in and took off with him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_01_END_3,Ultron? What does Ultron want with Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_0,"OK, bucket of bolts. Hand over my friend, and no one gets their spark plugs pulled."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_1,"Your alien friend developed a rare fungus I plan on augmenting to my needs. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_2,"Fungus? Your wiring's messed up, Toaster Head. Groot's NOT sick."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_3,Negative. The fungus is highly contagious. It is why he went into seclusion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_4,"If Groot's sick, we've got to help him. Hand him over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_5,Your threats are inconsequential.\nI tire of them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_INTRO_6,Fine then. Disassembly time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_0,Where are you holding Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_1,"He is guarded by an army of my drones. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_2,You will never reach him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_02_END_3,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_0,What's this you say about Groot being sick?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_1,"The tree alien was hiding because he did not want to contaminate anyone. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_2,I intend to mutate the fungus to destroy humanity.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_3,"Not a fan of ANY of that! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_4,Now where is he?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_5,Guarded by my Ultron army. There is no way to save him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_INTRO_6,I'm getting Groot. Even if I have to disassemble every single one of your tin can soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_0,"Groot, how could you just skip out like that? We're family!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_1,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_2,"I know you're sick, but we'll find a cure. Don't worry!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_3,"Rocket Raccoon, back away from Groot. The Kree cannot risk an outbreak. Groot must be eliminated."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_4,"Oh great, now you bozos had to show up and complicate things."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_03_END_5,"How about YOU back away, or I'll give you something to regret. I'm not abandoning Groot."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_0,"Step away from the infected alien. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_1,He must be exterminated for the safety of the galaxy.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_2,The infection cannot be allowed to spread.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_INTRO_3,I'm gonna rip out those cybernetics and build a coffee maker out of them!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_0,ROCKET'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> DOES\nMAJOR DAMAGE TO A SINGLE TARGET.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_1,BUT BE CAREFUL.\nROCKET'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> ALSO GIVES GROOT TAUNT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_FAIL_0,They took out Groot! No...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_0,"Well, they're down for the count. I think I've got an idea on where we can find you a cure."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_2,"It's risky, but that might work. I like it! I'll send a message and--"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_3,"This rotting tree has been judged as a threat to the Kree Empire. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_4,"Prepare for execution. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_04_END_5,"Take a number, pal.\nI got plenty of bullets. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_0,"Korath may have fallen for your tricks, but I will not."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_1,The Kree Empire has judged Groot's infection as an intergalactic threat.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_2,Not gonna happen. You gotta fight through us just like everybody else if you want a piece of him!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_INTRO_3,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_0,GROOT'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> GIVES <color=#fff568>DEATHPROOF</color> TO HIMSELF AND HIS ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_1,USE GROOT'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> TO <color=#fff568>HEAL</color> AND <color=#fff568>CLEAR NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> ON HIMSELF AND HIS ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_START_2,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_FAIL_0,Groot's down!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_0,"You fools, this tree's infection puts billions of lives at risk."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_1,We'll find a cure. I'm not giving up on him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_2,We will stop you. It's only a matter of time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_3,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_05_END_4,No. He's NOT right. We'll find another way.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_START_0,"This is A.I.M.'s formal requisition of the contaminated lifeform to study... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_START_1," ...with the intent of weaponizing the fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_FAIL_0,"Groot, no!!!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_0,"Commander, A.I.M. took Groot!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_1,They're going to experiment on him to weaponize the fungus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_06_END_2,They. Are. Going. To. Pay.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_0,"Hand over Groot, techno-geek."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_1,"This disease is magnificent. Once we weaponize it, it will make A.I.M. billions."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_2,So that's a no?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_3,Affirmative.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_4,Wait. Now I'm confused. You ARE going to hand him over?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_START_5,"Screw it. I'm just going to shoot you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_0,"Groot, did they hurt you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_07_END_2,"I mean, except for the fact that you still have an infectious, life-threatening fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_0,"Hey Groot, I just accessed A.I.M.'s medical database."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_1,Seems like when they tried to weaponize this disease you got...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_2,...they also developed a cure as a fail-safe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_3,What do you say we blast our way to the lab and steal the cure?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_4,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_INTRO_5,"Forty-two, actually. Why do you ask?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_START_0,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_08_END_1,"I guess we'll find out. Hopefully not too bad. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_0,"Just hand over the vaccine, and we'll be on our way."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_1,"A.I.M. will profit greatly from the weaponization of this infection. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_2,"Not if it means experimenting on my friend. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_INTRO_4,"I agree, Groot. Time for a different approach."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_START_0,"WHEN GROOT IS ON YOUR SIDE, ROCKET'S\n<color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> HITS FOR EVEN MORE DAMAGE."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_START_1,PROTECT <color=#fff568>GROOT</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_0,"OK, buddy. Looks like the antidote is working. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_1,You feel anything yet?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_2,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_3,Oh yeah... I'm gettin' dizzy... This stuff really works!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_4,We better sleep this one off.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_5,I'm sure everything will be fine by the morn--
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROCKET_09_END_6,I... am... Groot...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_0,Ultimus is moving to the next stage of his invasion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_1,"He once sought to conquer Earth intact, but we have stopped him so far. His next assault will devastate our world."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_2,"Ronan, S.T.R.I.K.E. has helped restore the Supreme Intelligence and liberate your homeworld, Hala. Now we need your help to save Earth."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_3,Very well. You have my attention.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_4,"S.T.R.I.K.E. forces from dimensions beyond the reach of Ultimus are willing to rally to our defense, but we need a way to get them here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_5,I need you to gather your best Kree commandos to help us improve our own trans-dimensional gate technology.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_6,Kree technology will save your people and Kree wrath will smite our enemies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_7,"Korath, find Minn-Erva. She leads our forces in the conflict at Nidavellir.\nHer bio-tech expertise is needed immediately."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_INTRO_8,It will be done.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_START_0,Focus your fire! Don't let that First Legion scum flank us!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_START_1,Advance! No mercy for traitors!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_START_2,USE MINN-ERVA'S BASIC ABILITY TO APPLY <color=#fff568>BLEED</color> TO AN ENEMY TARGET AND APPLY <color=#fff568>REGENERATION</color> TO THE MOST INJURED ALLY IN HER SQUAD.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_START_3,MINN-ERVA IS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEALER. <color=#fff568>KREE ALLIES</color> GAIN ADDITIONAL BENEFITS LIKE EXTRA ABILITY ENERGY.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_0,Minn-Erva... Ronan sent me to find you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_1,"Korath, what are you doing here?! There are fifty more traitors over that ridge!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_2,There were. I ended them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_3,"Well done, Korath. Hold your ground while I heal you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_4,"HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> WILL HEAL THE MOST INJURED ALLY, AS WELL AS <color=#fff568>REVIVE</color> A FALLEN ALLY."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_MID_5,"HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>BLEED</color> AND DRAINS HEALTH FROM ENEMIES TO HER ALLIES, APPLYING <color=#fff568>REGENERATION</color>."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_END_0,"It has been too long since we last fought side by side, Minn-Erva."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_END_1,Indeed it has. Tell me of Ronan's latest demands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_END_2,Doctor Minn-Erva! The traitors have regrouped and are attacking the city!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_01_END_3,"I guess we'll have to discuss this later, Korath. Ready yourself."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_INTRO_0,"What is happening here, Minn-Erva?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_INTRO_1,The First Legion traitors are on the march. It's as if they are preparing for a large scale operation.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_INTRO_2,They are. Ultimus has commenced his Helicarrier invasion on Earth.\nRonan seeks your aid in gathering a fleet of our own.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_INTRO_3,Damn! Then our forces must withdraw. Help me protect our people as they evacuate.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_START_0,We'll hit them hard so our forces have time to withdraw.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_START_1,A victory here will cripple their command structure and protect our allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_END_0,"Our job is done here. The fleet has completed preparations for a jump to Earth, where they can aid in its defense."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_02_END_1,And we go to Hala. Ronan will be waiting.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_0,We must contact allies of consequence in dimensions untouched by Ultimus and\nbring them to Earth.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_1,The Supreme Intelligence has provided us with the schematics for a Fractal Replicator.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_2,A device of that scale would allow the humans to build gates large enough to transport S.T.R.I.K.E. Helicarriers from other dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_3,"With enough allies untainted by Ultimus, we may stand\na fighting chance of stopping his invasion of Earth."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_4,Could you calibrate such a gate to pierce the veil and reach the correct dimension?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_5,"I believe so, but we'll also need a power source capable of stabilizing a trans-dimensional portal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_6,We will need a reliable source of Phlogistone. Our stockpiles\nwere raided when Ultimus first attacked Hala.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_INTRO_7,Then we will take back what is ours.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_START_0,Corrupted forces have a large stockpile of Phlogistone being kept under lock and key in a bunker up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_START_1,"If we can quietly take care of local patrols, we can get to the stockpile before they try to destroy it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_START_2,"Quiet or not, these heathens will ALL face swift judgment for their misdeeds."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_MID_0,Doctor. Accuser.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_MID_1,Step aside. Before my nanobots dissolve your body into a puddle of enchanted goo.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_MID_2,"Keep dreaming, blue. Ain't nothing you can do to stop me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_END_0,These patrols appear to have alerted the bunker to our presence.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_03_END_1,We need to get in there fast before they set the whole place to blow.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INTRO_0,The Phlogistone is being held on sublevel 18.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INTRO_1,What happens if they attempt to destroy the Phlogistone before we can secure it?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INTRO_2,"If the ore becomes unstable, it can cause degenerative effects such as obsession, megalomania, and psychosis. It may also explode."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INTRO_3,Concerns for the weak-minded. Forward!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_START_0,Stay back. Or we WILL destroy this Phlogistone! For the glory of Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_START_1,We must focus our attacks on their operators. Only then can we protect the stockpile from becoming unstable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_1_0,"Focus on their operators, we cannot risk a rupture in the Phlogistone supply."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_2_0,We are running out of time. They are de-stabilizing the Phlogistone cannisters.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_3_0,Fools! Focus your attacks on their operators! They must be punished.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_FAIL_0,"We are too late, take cover! Before they--"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_END_0,The Phlogistone supply is stable. Let's get out of here before reinforcements arrive.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_04_END_1,No. Let them come. We are not leaving until every last one of these corrupted Kree heathens has been JUDGED.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_INTRO_0,"Ronan, we cannot stay here! If we do not bring the Phlogistone back in time, Ultimus will overwhelm Nexus Earth and all will be lost."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_INTRO_1,"You must have faith, Doctor. We walk the one true path of the Kree.\nAll will happen as it must."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_INTRO_2,All traitors of the First Legion will face judgment by my hand.\nThese usurpers must be punished for their crimes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_START_0,You all stand guilty of heresy! High treason in the one true Empire of the Kree!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_START_1,So pronounces - Ronan the Accuser!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_START_2,"Ronan, you're an arrogant jerk\nin every reality."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_START_3,I am gonna knock that smug look off your face. For Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_1_0,"Ronan, we're trapped. They just keep coming..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_1_1,Then we die well!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_2_0,"Today's your lucky day, Accuser.\nGlad I got here in time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_2_1,"CAPTAIN MARVEL IS A FORMIDABLE COSMIC SOLDIER. HER <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> CHAINS TO MULTIPLE TARGETS, AND SHE GAINS <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_2_2,HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> TARGETS A SINGLE ENEMY WITH A CHANCE TO REMOVE <color=#fff568>POSITIVE EFFECTS</color>. SHE ALSO GAINS <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_MID_2_3,USE HER UNAVOIDABLE <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> TO UNLEASH <color=#fff568>BINARY FORM</color>. SHE REMAINS IN BINARY FORM WHILE <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_END_0,Let's get the Phlogistone out of here before the First Legion nukes this place from orbit!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_05_END_1,"Very well, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_0,I must return to Earth with the Phlogistone so that Replicator construction can begin.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_1,It will be done in secret in a place where the project will be protected with cloaking.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_2,Good. But we are still no closer to determining the mineral needed for tuning each gate to dimensions untouched by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_3,The Supreme Intelligence believes a Kree once touched by the Celestials has the answer. He may have a connection to such a material.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_4,Of course. A Kree Eternal! And there's only one that we know of that has yet to be corrupted by the likes of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_5,Ard-Con.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_INTRO_6,Just what we need in our lives...\nMORE Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_START_0,"Ok, this is the meeting spot! And... it's crawling with corrupted forces. Great."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_START_1,Ard-Con must be nearby.\nLet's clear the area.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_MID_0,"Those mercenaries have been pursuing me for weeks. No matter how many I crush, they always send more."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_MID_1,"Yeah, the other Ultimus wants you bad.\nHe must not like the competition."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_FAIL_0,Ard-Con is down. We've failed!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_END_0,"Ard-Con, we require your knowledge. The Supreme Intelligence believes you know of a rare Celestial mineral needed to save our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_END_1,Have you ever come across a Celestial mineral with a unique dimensional resonance signature?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_END_2,What you speak of is a mineral created long ago by the Celestial known as Ego.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_END_3,And there is only one being in the galaxy who's been in close enough contact with Ego to possibly know of where to find such a mineral.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_06_END_4,Mantis.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_0,"Minn-Erva, I hate to leave you hanging, but the Kree fleet is getting decimated trying to hold the line in orbit around Earth. They need me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_1,"Go. Salvage what you can. Once we find the mineral supply the Replicator needs, we'll return with haste."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_2," --"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_3,Korath tells me that you would know where to find Mantis.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_4,"Last I heard, she was helping S.T.R.I.K.E. forces save refugees on the planet Arago-7.\nHope she's okay..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_5,Why the concern?\nIs S.T.R.I.K.E. not protecting her?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_6,Drax is with her. I'm just not sure\nthat lugnut can handle corrupted forces led by Carnage.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_7,"Carnage is dumber than a bag of hammers, but he's scary violent."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_8,With Ultimus pulling his strings he could be even more dangerous!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_9,"It's okay, Rocket. We're going\nin to extract her."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_INTRO_10,She'll be safe with us. I promise.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_0,"Stay away from me, you monster!\nDon't make me hurt you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_1,"Yes, make ME hurt you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_2,YOU WILL REGRET NOT JOINING ULTIMUS SOONER... YEESSSS...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_3,"Mantis, we're here to help. Let's dispatch this malignant tumor and be done with it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_4,"MANTIS IS A POTENT COSMIC HEALER. AT THE START OF BATTLE, SHE HAS A CHANCE TO GAIN <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>, WHICH ALLOWS HER <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> TO <color=#fff568>STUN</color> AN ENEMY TARGET."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_5,"HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> HEALS AND APPLIES <color=#fff568>REGENERATION</color> TO ALL ALLIES, WITH CLOSER ALLIES GETTING HEALED FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_START_6,"HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE</color> REDISTRIBUTES HEALTH BETWEEN HER AND THE LOWEST HEALTH ALLY. ON TURN, SHE HEALS HERSELF."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_FAIL_0,Mantis! NO!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_0,"Thank you for your help, Minn-Erva.\nI am in your debt!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_1,"Of course. But WE are the ones who need YOUR help, Mantis."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_2,We need to know about\na rare Celestial mineral that Ego once created.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_3,A mineral with a unique dimensional resonance signature. Do you know of such a mineral?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_4,Ego once bragged about creating a resonant mineral and showed me a sample. I have felt this same resonance on Yondu's homeworld.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_07_END_5,It can be found on Centauri-IV.\nThe people there call it Yaka.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_0,Centauri-IV appears to be largely untouched by Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_1,"Ultimus only cares about Earth. His empire spans many realities, but his forces are slow to conquer other worlds in those dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_2,"If we are lucky, the Yaka mineral quarries will be safe from his forces."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_3," ...I feel the presence of corruption on this world.\nPerhaps we are not lucky."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_4,"Drax, stay and protect the ship.\nWe will need to leave quickly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_INTRO_5,Let them come!\nI WILL PROTECT THIS SHIP\nLIKE NO SHIP HAS EVER BEEN PROTECTED BEFORE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_START_0,"Well, lookee here. Some fresh faces for us to hand over to Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_START_1,It appears that we are unlucky.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_START_2,"THEY are the unlucky ones, Mantis. Behold the power of Kree nanobots..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_08_END_0,"Yaka mineral reserve secured.\nWe must load this onto the ship and return to Earth, quickly!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_0,This mineral is astonishing! It is able to resonate to complex information about individual dimensions with fantastic precision and efficiency.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_1,We'll be able to identify the locations of safe dimensions to enter within hours!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_2,Ego was very proud of creating this mineral. It makes me a little sad that he never got the chance to see it used for such good in this universe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_3,Sometimes a monster CAN create something beautiful. Speaking of which--
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_4,"Minn-Erva. You have arrived JUST in time. Our fleet grows weaker with every passing hour. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_5,We have created the first gateway. It is hidden in a place called Wakanda.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_6,"The Replicator builds more gates as we speak, but the dogs of Ultimus draw near."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_INTRO_7,Eliminate his scouts before they reveal our plan.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_START_0,"Team, you know what to do. Destroy everything. Leave nothing intact."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_START_1,We have to protect the facility at all costs. Stop them before they find the gates!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_MID_0,"You continue to come and go as you please, Captain."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_MID_1,Sorry for the holdup. Had to recharge. These invading Helicarriers are tough nuts to crack.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_0,How we lookin'?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_1,"Gates are constructed and stable. Dimensional signatures are locked in, ready for activation."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_2,Have we made successful contact with any of these dimensions yet?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_3,"S.T.R.I.K.E. forces from parallel dimensions are locked and loaded. If this works, we'll have a fleet of allied Helicarriers to face Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_4,Activate trans-dimensional portals! Let's show Ultimus what\ntrue unity looks like.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_5,"You really came through when it was needed. Well done, Accuser."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_6,"I had very little to do with our success. The victories of Minn-Erva, Captain Marvel, Mantis... they bring glory to our alliance."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_7,"With the might of a thousand allied dimensions, your planet will be saved and the heretic Ultimus will face the judgment of the Kree."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KR_09_END_8,"We bought ourselves another day in the fight, but a new challenge awaits us tomorrow. And the day after that. I'm glad you're on our side."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_INTRO_0,"Cable, come in. We've got most of the mutant population out of Limbo. What's your status?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_INTRO_1,"We're holding the line, but Ultimus's forces are pushing forward, hard."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_INTRO_2,It's almost like they don't want us joinin' the real fight.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_INTRO_3,"Buy us some time, then follow us back to the Nexus dimension. Cyclops out."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_INTRO_4,"Let us show Ultimus what we X-Men can do. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_START_0,"Commander, I've got the mutants in my sights. Ready to fi-aargh!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_START_1,"Oh, I'm sorry, Red Skull - was that your sniper? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_START_2,Hydra! Stand strong and destroy these genetic mistakes!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_MID_0,PSYLOCKE IS A DEADLY MUTANT BRAWLER WHO EXCELS AT MANIPULATING STATUS EFFECTS ON THE FRIENDLY AND ENEMY TEAMS.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_MID_1,"PSYLOCKE'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> CHAINS TO MULTIPLE TARGETS, CLEARING <color=#fff568>POSTITIVE EFFECTS</color> WITH EACH ATTACK."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_MID_2,PSYLOCKE'S POWERFUL <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> ALLOWS HER TO TRANSFER <color=#fff568>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> FROM TEAMMATES TO HER TARGET.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_MID_2_0,"Skull, the only good thing about this fiasco is me gettin' to slice and dice you over and over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_0,"The last of the mutants are through the portal! X-Men, fall back!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_1,You're not going anywhere. Let's see how those mutants survive without you X-Men to protect them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_2,"Bub, I know the real Cap, and you ain't fit to shine his shield. Let's go!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_3,Wolverine! Do not engage!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_4," --ARGH!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_5,"How do you like our new psionic snare? As of now, the X-Men are on lockdown."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_01_END_6,"...Not all of us.\nCyclops, I managed to avoid capture, and I'm on my way to you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_0,The only place Ultimus's Avengers could have brought the team is his conversion facility in Limbo.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_1,That place is a fortress. We don't have the manpower to launch a frontal assault.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_2,"Lucky for us all, I work best in the shadows."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_3,"With the rest of the X-Men gone, I need to stay and protect our people. You'd be going in alone."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_4,Not alone. I just need others that share my particular talents.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_INTRO_5,"Sounds like you have someone in mind. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_0,Phew! That was... a lot of Hand guys.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_1,"We're not done yet, Rand. When we clear out this stronghold, Ultimus's grip on the Hand will be loosened."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_2,"I think you mean ""if"", not ""when"", Elektra. Prepare to die."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_3,You know what?\nI definitely have enough chi left in the tank to kick this guy's crimson butt.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_4,Perhaps you could use some assistance?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_START_5,"Psylocke! Always glad to have another ninja on this side of the fight. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_END_0,Your assistance was most welcome. We're in your debt.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_END_1,"A debt you can repay immediately.\nI need your help. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_END_2,Ultimus has captured the X-Men in Limbo. I need your help to infiltrate his base and return them safely to S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_02_END_3,Sounds like a challenge.\nWhen do we leave?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_INTRO_0,This is the facility where the X-Men are being held?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_INTRO_1,Ultimus's conversion base in Limbo. He's taken a lot of mutants for his cause. We rescued many of them...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_INTRO_2,But at the cost of leaving our friends behind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_INTRO_3,They'll be free soon enough.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_START_0,The holding cell is this way. We should be undetected.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_START_1,"By others, maybe. But not by me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_START_2,"Here's a tip for you: if you want to sneak into a place, don't do it while I'm here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_0,Widow was right. If there's more of her around we're not going to be able to sneak out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_1,"Who said anything about ""sneaking"" out? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_2,"Murdock, did you find our exit?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_3,I did. And he was extremely happy to see me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_4,"Preevyet, Psylocke! It is good to be free again."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_5,"Piotr, how do you feel about breaking down some walls?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_6,It would be my biggest of pleasures.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_03_END_7,"Let's get our family back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_0,I can't believe we finally caught the X-Men.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_1,"It's good news for us, but I do not want to be the one guarding the little Canadian one."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_2,"You're telling me. Did you hear what he did to Gary? Guy's gonna... wait, do you feel that?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_3,What?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_4,That... rumbling?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_5,"Hello, small villains! You will want to be moving out of my way now!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_INTRO_6,"Aw, crap! Sound the alarm!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_START_0,These troops are the last thing between us and the rest of the X-Men!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_START_1,"Get behind me, friend teammates! I will shelter you from harm."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_START_2,I'm not used to attracting all this attention. Can't he be quieter?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_START_3,"Trust me, for Colossus this is quiet."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_MID_0,"COLOSSUS IS THE X-MEN'S PROTECTOR WHO SHELTERS HIS ALLIES FROM HARM AND DAMAGES ENEMIES WHO ATTACKS HIM. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_MID_1,COLOSSUS'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>OFFENSE DOWN</color> WHILE DEALING DAMAGE. HIS <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> GRANTS HIM <color=#fff568>TAUNT</color> AND <color=#fff568>COUNTER</color>.

ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_END_0,Elizabeth. Thank you for your timely rescue.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_END_1,"Don't thank us yet. We still have to leave this dreadful place. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_END_2,"What of you, Logan? Are you ready for battle?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_END_3,Grrrrr...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_04_END_4,He is ready!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_START_0,This Kree vessel will get us out of Limbo if we can clear the way for our escape.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_START_1,"After being trapped in that cage, gettin' rid of Ultimus's punks ain't gonna be a problem, 'Ro."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_START_2,"Say what you will about Ultimus, but he's got plenty of spaceships for us to steal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_START_3,PROTECT <color=#fff568>HAND ASSASSIN</color> WHILE THEY OPEN THE PORTAL OUT OF LIMBO TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_1_0,The process has begun. Defend our ally!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_2_0,We have opened the portal! Just a little longer until it's stable!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_3_0,"We're so close! Hold the line, we're almost home."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_OPERATOR_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_MID_0,You mutants have cost Ultimus too much already.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_MID_1,Take them down! No mercy!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_FAIL_0,The portal is collapsing! We're trapped.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_FAIL_1,All of you belong to Ultimus now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_0,Brace for passage through the portal!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_1,Are these ships supposed to rattle so much?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_2,Hold tight!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_3,And...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_4,"...we're through! The mission was a success. Congratulations, Psylocke."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_5,I couldn't have done it without you all. You have my gratitude.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_6,All of ours.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_05_END_7,"X-Men, welcome back to Earth. Let's hope we survive the experience."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_0,Psylocke. I heard about what you and your team pulled off in Limbo. Impressive.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_1,You all got into a heavily guarded facility and managed to make a real mess on your way out...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_2,And?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_3,Think you can do it a few more times?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_4,It'd be my pleasure.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_INTRO_5,Pack your bags.\nYou're going to Jupiter.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_START_0,We're in. Fury said this was the first of three facilities he wanted investigated?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_START_1,Ultimus is building something here on the moons of Jupiter. Fury wants to find out what.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_START_2,The last thing standing between us and the intel... is them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_START_3,"You! How did you get in here? Kree, stop them!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_END_0,"Fury, we've sent the data back your way."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_END_1,"Our big brains are analyzing it, but looks like we'll need data from the other facilities before we get the full story."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_END_2,Head to the next moon and report back. And see if you can't leave Ultimus's toys in worse shape than we found them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_06_END_3,"You got it, bub."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_INTRO_0,"We've been to other dimensions, I've fought a dragon, and I still can't believe we're on one of Jupiter's moons."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_INTRO_1,It's a long way from Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_INTRO_2,"How are your senses holding up here, hornhead? They must be going crazy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_INTRO_3,"Actually, they have to adjust in every new dimension. Being in our own is comforting, even on a moon."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_START_0,"You may have avoided this base's sensors, but your auras are too bright to hide from me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_END_0,"Fury, this facility has been heavily augmented by mystical technology."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_END_1,"The last one was focused on drawing in cosmic radiation. If this is a combination of the two, I don't like where this is leading."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_07_END_2,Find the third base. Whatever's happening... we don't want it happening before we're ready.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_0,"We've reached the heart of the facility. Whatever they're doing here, they're doing it here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_1,Someone's coming! Find cover!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_2,"Has the Vibranium fully integrated with the engine yet, sister?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_3,"We're close. Once the conversion technology finishes, Ultimus will be able to fully capture and control the entity."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_4,"If they're that close to completing this machine, it sounds like the time for stealth is over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_INTRO_5,That's what I like to hear.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_START_0,Intruders. You will soon regret this trespass.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_START_1,"Pal, I always wondered if I could cut through Vibranium. I guess we're about to find out."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_END_0,"This Vibranium-powered Conversion Engine... Fury, what were they doing here?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_END_1,"Thanks to your intel, our techs are piecing together everything now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_END_2,These facilities were built to draw in and capture something for Ultimus. Something powerful.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_08_END_3,"If he wants it, we can't let him have it. Shut down this facility and keep Ultimus from capturing whatever it is."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_INTRO_0,Fury wants this facility kept out of Ultimus's hands. We need to keep him from capturing this cosmic entity.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_INTRO_1,"Wait a sec. If we're destroying the device that traps this thing, but it's still on its way here..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_INTRO_2,Let's hope we're not here when it arrives.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_INTRO_3,"Well, let's make it quick - here comes Ultimus's goon squad."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_START_0,Let's make an example out of these intruders.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_START_1,Agents? Take this place back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_MID_0,Comrades! Commander Fury sends his greetings and my assistance.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_0,"That's it. Whatever this device was, it's destroyed now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_1,*cough*... You think you've won?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_2,You're in shackles aren't you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_3,Heh... A facility this important and you think Ultimus would send just us to protect it?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_4,Braddock. Outside. Ultimus has the facility surrounded.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_5,There's no way we can fight off this many.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_6,S.T.R.I.K.E. team! Our scien-- have put all the intel tog--her. We know who Ul---mus --- trying to ---!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_7,It's the --zzkt--
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_8,"Fury? Fury, come in! Something's interfering with the signal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_9,"Whatever it is, it's here. I can sense it. Something powerful."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_10,And... familiar?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_PSY_09_END_11,
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, we have a problem."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_1,We've lost contact with Ant-Man and his team while they were doing some recon work on Doom's Sokovian outpost...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_2,"*gasp* Did you hear that, America? I have to go help him!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_3,"Easy there, Chica. They're full-fledged S.T.R.I.K.E. agents! You're still getting used to your powers."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_4,"I've been practicing! Besides, he's my Dad! I have to try to save him."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_INTRO_5,Just teleport me there and stand back! I've got a big idea.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_START_0,"Just a little longer, everyone. S.T.R.I.K.E.'s gotta be on their way already."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_START_1,That's what you said five hours ago. I knew I should never have trusted S.T.R.I.K.E. to have my back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_START_2,YELLOWJACKET IS A <color=#fff568>BLASTER</color> THAT DRAINS THE LIFE FROM HIS ENEMIES AND BOOSTS <color=#fff568>VILLAIN TECH</color> ALLIES
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_START_3,GHOST USES HER QUANTUM ENERGY ABILITIES TO CONTROL ENEMY NEGATIVE EFFECTS AND <color=#fff568>HEAL PYM TECH</color> ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_0,Dad! I'm here to bring you back home.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_1,Cassie?! What are you doing here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_2,"Survive now, argue later! Look for an opening and run to America, she'll teleport us all back to HQ."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_3,"STATURE IS A PROTECTOR WHO <color=#fff568>TAUNTS</color> AND GRANTS <color=#fff568>EVADE</color> TO HER TEAM WHEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_4,STATURE KEEPS HER TEAM IN THE FIGHT BY GRANTING ABILITY ENERGY WHERE THEY NEED IT MOST.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_MID_5,"WHEN ANT-MAN'S AROUND, DAD TAKES OVER STATURE'S <color=#fff568>TAUNT</color> WHEN SHE'S BADLY HURT."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_0,Phew! That was a close one!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_1,CASSIE! What were you thinking?! You could have gotten hurt out there!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_2,But I didn't!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_3,"Didn't you see me? I've totally got control of my powers. I can be an agent of S.T.R.I.K.E., just like you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_4,"An agent?! Oh man, your mom would kill me. You know what?\nYou're grounded."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_5,"What?! I literally just saved everyone, that's so unfair!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_6,"Being an agent is about more than just swooping in and saving the day. You need to be able to think about the consequences. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_7,"It all worked out, but you didn't just put yourself in danger, you put America in danger, too."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_01_END_8,"I'm sorry, Peanut. But I'm sending you home to your mom's."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_0,"Come on, come on, it's gotta be around here somewhere..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_1,Cassie? What are you doing in my quarters?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_2,"Ah! Hope, sorry, but I'm tired of sitting at home feeling useless. I need to show Dad that I can help!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_3,"I'm taking your Pym Particle regulator to get to the Quantum Realm! If I prove myself, Dad will have to let me join S.T.R.I.K.E.!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_4,"Cassie, no! Wait!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_5,Scott! Cassie stole my regulator and jumped into the Quantum Realm. She has no idea how bad things are there!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_6,"This is my fault, I shouldn't have been so hard on her..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_7,"Scott, focus. Go, bring her back safely. We can talk about your parenting technique later. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_INTRO_8,Right. Wish me luck!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_START_0,Cassie! I'm so glad the tracker on the regulator works down here. We have to get out of here. Now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_START_1,"Dad?! You followed me? Well, it doesn't matter, I'm not leaving until I prove to you that I'm ready to be in S.T.R.I.K.E.!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_START_2,"I get that, but this is not the place to prove yourself. The Quantum Realm is dangerous."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_START_3,"You should listen to your father, little ant. Baron Zemo does not like intruders."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_0,Did he say Baron Zemo? How did he get into the Quantum Realm?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_1,"I don't know. Something's not right here... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_2,"Look, once Earth is safe, Hope and I will come back and figure out what's going on, I promise. But we're going home. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_3,"Um, why are there sparks coming off your regulator? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_4,"Well, that's just great. It got damaged in the fight. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_02_END_5,"*Sigh* Come on, we are going to pay an old friend a visit. I'm never going to hear the end of this."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_INTRO_0,"So, where are we going? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_INTRO_1,"There's a tiny Earth here in the Quantum Realm, complete with its own Ant-Man. He can help get you out of here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_INTRO_2,Woah! Two Dads... Is he just like you? Does he also know magic? How often do you hang out? Do you finish each other's--
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_INTRO_3,"Cassie! Enough with the questions. This isn't a field trip, this is serious."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_INTRO_4,"The Ant-Man here isn't anything like me. He's kind of a jerk, honestly. Greedy. Selfish. We'll need to trade him something for his regulator. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_START_0,"The only trade I'm interested in is trading you two in to Zemo for a reward. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_START_1,"You two are trespassing. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_START_2,And Baron Zemo hates trespassers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_MID_0,"Why do I always have to rescue you, Scottie?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_MID_1,Good to see a friendly face in this place. Now let's finish this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_0,Hope?! You followed us here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_1,"This Wasp isn't our Hope, Cassie. She lives here in the Quantum Realm, and has saved my butt before. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_2,"Hope, what's going on here? Since when is Zemo in charge?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_3,"A lot's changed since you left, Scott. Doctor Doom came down and conquered parts of our world. Renamed it to Mirwood."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_4,"But when he returned to Nexus Earth, our Zemo took over. Now, some of us are fighting back. We could use your help."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_5,"Yes! OMG, we'd love to help! That's exactly the kind of thing I came here for!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_6,"Woah, no way. Sorry, Hope, but my only goal is to fix this regulator and get Cassie home. She's not ready for any of this."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_03_END_7,"I understand. Well, I might have some regulator parts back at my base. Let's see what we can do."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_0,"Hope, I swear, as soon as Cassie's home and safe, I'll gather my team and we'll come back to help."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_1,Any chance you have an army handy? We'll need one to go against Zemo. Everyone here is terrified of him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_2,"Heh, I'll see what I can do. Now, where's your base?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_3,Just ahead. It's hidden from... Oh no.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_4,Woah. Your base is inside this huge crater? That's so cool!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_5,Cassie...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_6,"This is bad. I was just here, which means whoever did this is still..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_7,"Sister, look! We seem to have missed some resistance scum."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_INTRO_8,...nearby. Crap.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_START_0,Our orders were to eliminate any resistance we find! Get them!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_END_0,"Dad, I want to stay and help! We have to! Look at what I can do. If we team up we can stop Zemo, I just know it!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_END_1,"Cassie, you're amazing. I'm so proud of everything you can do. But you're just too young to be fighting this fight. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_END_2,"Hope, tell him! You saw what I can do. Tell him I'm ready to be a hero."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_END_3,"Oh, no. Sorry, kid, I'm staying out of this. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_04_END_4,"But I do think I know someone else who might be able to help you two get home. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_0,"Oh, man, Doctor Strange? He's not still mad at me, is he?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_1,For the time you accidentally shrunk his hand? He might be! It took him forever to figure out how to reverse the Pym Particles.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_2,"It wasn't my fault! I warned him that batch was unstable. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_3,All the spells he tried to cast while his hand was shrunken were tiny! He nearly lost an arm trying to squeeze through a teeny portal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_4,Sounds like you had a lot of fun when you were here. Why did you stop coming back?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_5,"This place was my home away from home. But you were back on Nexus Earth. I had to focus on you, Peanut."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_INTRO_6,And that's where you should have stayed.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_START_0,"You sure do have a lot of friends here, Dad."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_START_1,"Yeah well, what can I say? I'm a popular guy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_05_END_0,"Come on, we need to move quickly. If they capture Doctor Strange at our safe house, you'll be out of options."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_START_0,"By the Seven Rings of Raggadorr, you will not take this place!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_START_1,"The Sorcerer Supreme! I'm a huge fan! I've got your back, Doctor Strange!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_START_2,…And who is this?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_START_3,Just go with it. They're here to help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_START_4,PROTECT THE ALLIES
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_0,"Wasp, Cassie, you have my thanks."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_1,What about me? I lent a hand! You know… to make up for that hand shrinking thing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_2,"Yes. Well... What do you want, Scott?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_3,My regulator broke and me and Cassie are stuck here. I'm hoping you can open up a portal and send us back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_4,"I'm not going anywhere. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_5,"You can ground me 'til I'm 30, I don't care! But how can you just go home without helping? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_6,"Cassie, you've got to listen to me, I'm making these rules to keep you safe. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_7,"Okay, but how many times have you broken the rules because it was the right thing to do?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_8,"Dad. Please. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_06_END_9,"…Sigh. Okay, fine. We can stay. But don't tell your mom I said it was okay! Or Nick Fury! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_0,There's a lot more resistance members than I thought! Where are we going? How did Zemo get so powerful?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_1,"So many questions. Let's see, the resistance is growing. There are more of us every day. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_2,We are heading to A.I.M.'s warehouse. Last time I was here they were working on replicating Pym's tech.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_3,"And as for Zemo, he scared people into following him and betrayed Doom's loyalists. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_4,He took advantage of anyone in need.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_INTRO_5,We're here. Follow our lead and try to be silent.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_START_0,"We can't just stop them, we have to destroy all their research, and quickly!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_START_1,"PROTECT THE OPERATOR "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_01_0,Starting to set the charges now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_02_0,"Hooking up a few more charges, keep buying me time!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_03_0,Getting to a safe distance!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,No! They destroyed the last of our blasting agents!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_END_0,"That was so cool! But we can do more, right? Why don't we take the fight right to Zemo?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_END_1,"Cas, he's too strong. We'd need an army to take that lunatic down."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_END_2,"He might be strong, but that doesn't mean we just give up, right? Taking on people bigger than us is kind of our specialty. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_END_3,"Wait, did I hear that right? Dad, you're on my side?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_07_END_4,"I'm always on your side, Cassie."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_0,Some of Zemo's lieutenants are meeting at the docks tonight. We can set up an ambush.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_1,"Wow, how'd you know about that?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_2,We've been trailing them since Zemo rose to power. They get together there for a weekly poker game.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_3,The loser usually gets turned into Hela's pet afterwards.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_4,Well? What are we waiting for?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_INTRO_5,"You know, she really does take after you, Scott."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_START_0,"They are all here, just like you said they would be!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_START_1,We attack on my mark. They won't know what hit them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_0,"Woah, we just took out ALL of his lieutenants. I've never seen all of them here before!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_1,"This will be enough to weaken Zemo's forces until he promotes new lieutenants. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_2,"Then let's hurry up and hit him where it hurts, his main base."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_3,"With his leaders out of action, he won't be able to gather his army in time to stop us."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_4,"Kid, you're onto something here. I'm getting a plan. Well, half a plan."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_5,Better than the twelve percent of a plan Star-Lord usually has.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_6,"Scott, by the way, no one blames you for not coming back, your daughter needed you. You did good with her."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_08_END_7,"Thank you, I really needed to hear that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_0,Baron Zemo! Your reign of tyranny is over.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_1,"Over? Ah, dear bug, my rule over this world has only begun."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_2,You have all made a grave mistake coming directly to me. Hela! Octavius! Get rid of these intruders!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_3,Dad and I demoted your lieutenants. No one left to protect you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_4,"You don't hire underlings to protect you, child. You hire them to deal with things that are beneath you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_INTRO_5,"But if I'm forced down to your level, so be it. I'll show you true strength. Prepare to meet your end!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_0,It's... it's over. I can't believe that we won! We beat that power-hungry dictator!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_1,"Thank you both so much. Especially you, Cassie. If you hadn't stayed... Who knows what would have happened?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_2,"Yes, this world owes you both a great debt. But for now, I can begin repaying it with a portal back home."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_3,"Cassie, before we head back, I just wanted to let you know how proud I am of you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_4,"I'm always going to worry about you, but the way you put the people of this world before yourself? That's real heroism."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_5,"I'll talk to your mom, but as far as I'm concerned you're ready to become a full-fledged S.T.R.I.K.E. agent."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_6,"Thanks for listening to me, Dad. I think I understand, now, what S.T.R.I.K.E. is really about… "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_7,Teamwork really does make the dream work.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_STATURE_09_END_8,"Great! Because other than going on missions, you're still totally grounded. Probably forever! Maybe longer."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_0,"Fury, we've made headway on the offensive, but Doom's forces are returning fire."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_1,"Get the X-Men to lay down air support and push the assault! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_2,"If we cut off their exit route, it's over. One less squad of Doom's goons to deal with later."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_3,"I've got to admit, for a guy with one eye, you sure do see all the angles."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_4,"That's the job, Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_5,"Wait, something's happening... There's a huge energy shockwave coming in and--"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_6,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_7,Wha.. what dimension is this?! Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_INTRO_8,"No idea, but I know Avengers when I see 'em. Take 'em out now and ask questions later!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_START_0,"Uh, Fury, was this sudden influx of bad guys part of your master plan, or...?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_START_1,Whatever caused that shockwave dropped them right on top of us!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_START_2,"I'm not sure from where, but we have to hold the line or we'll be overrun!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_0,"Reinforcements are still hours out... If anyone has any last-minute tricks, now's the time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_1,"Like that portal opening up? That one's not on me, I don't have portal powers. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_2,Fury?! Is that really you? Am I home?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_3,"My god... It's Kestrel! EVERYONE, FOLLOW HER LEAD, NOW!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_4,"KESTREL'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> CHAINS <color=#fff568>DEFENSE DOWN</color> TO A SERIES OF ENEMIES, WHILE HER UNBLOCKABLE <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>DEFENSE DOWN</color> TO THE WHOLE ENEMY TEAM. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_5,"WHENEVER KESTREL'S ALLIES ATTACK AN ENEMY WITH <color=#fff568>DEFENSE DOWN</color>, HER <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> LETS HER MAKE AN ATTACK AGAINST THE MOST INJURED ENEMY."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_MID_6,"KESTREL ALSO CONTROLS THE BATTLEFIELD - ENEMIES TAKEN OUT BY HER <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> CANNOT BE REVIVED, AND WHILE SHE'S <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color> ENEMIES CANNOT SUMMON OR CLONE."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_0,Is this the Nexus? Did I make it back?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_1,"Yes! And maybe? Uh, not to be rude, but who are you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_2,"Don't get me wrong, I love a fashionably late dramatic entrance, but I have questions."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_3,I'm Major Sybil Tan. And this isn't exactly the welcome home I was expecting...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_4,"You'll have to forgive Stark, he left his manners in his other suit. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_5,"Team, meet codename Kestrel. An old friend, and founding member of S.T.R.I.K.E. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_6,I can't believe you're standing here in front of us. Where have you been?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_7,"Everywhere, Fury. I've been everywhere. And things are worse out there than you might think. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_01_END_8,"Ultimus is almost free. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_0,"Back when everyone thought this war was my sci-fi paranoia, Sybil helped me build S.T.R.I.K.E. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_1,"She led the team that created our first portal. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_2,"I don't get it - if you founded S.T.R.I.K.E., where have you been all this time?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_3,"Yeah, the tech... needed work. I was the first human to try out the portal... And then it destabilized. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_4,"You kept that portal from blowing a hole in the multiverse and taking everyone on our Helicarrier with it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_5,I thought you died a hero. Glad to see I was only half right.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_6,"I'd like to stay alive, if possible. As glad as I am to be home, there's a crisis we need to solve, now. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_INTRO_7,"Portal up, folks. I'll explain on the way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_START_0,We're being invaded! Protect the Pym Particles!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_START_1,"Corrupted Kree with Pym Particles? That's got to be bad news. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_START_2,Defend the supplies! For Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_START_3,See? I told you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_0,We haven't seen the Corrupted Kree in a while. And now they're harvesting Pym Particles? Why?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_1,"They've developed tech that can shrink and expand dimensions rapidly. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_2,"Sounds kind of fun, actually."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_3,It destroys the dimensions and creates a shockwave of energy that shakes all reality.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_4,"Okay, so... Less fun, then."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_5,"That energy is being funneled into Ultimus's prison - they're trying to free him. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_6,"I was working on a way to stop this when a shockwave hit and knocked me and those bad guys back to Nexus Earth. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_7,"Fate's funny.  Paths split and converge, dimensions form and collapse, in the most surprising ways."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_02_END_8,"I spent years trying to find my way home, and Ultimus's goons did it for me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_START_0,"That's the device harvesting the Pym Particles from this dimension. You guys cover me, and I can take out the Kree operating it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_START_1,"I can help! I know we don't know each other, but I'm no slouch in the science department. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_START_2,"Oh man, that'd be great. Can you help calculate this dimensional matrix while I work to untangle the very fabric of reality?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_START_3,"Uh... you heard the lady, cover her while she counteracts the doodad!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_0,Stop them! Open fire!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_1,I said cover me!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_2,You're covered! You're covered!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_3,"Okay, I've crossed the wires and dotted the matrices, this thing should be ready to detonate. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_4,"I'm sorry, did you say ""detonate""?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_5,"Yeah, you didn't think I was going to let them keep it, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_6,Ultimus's empire... will rise again...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_7,"Wait, they're activating the machine one last time! Hold on!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_03_END_8,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_0,Ugh... I need a sitrep. What happened?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_1,"The Kree turned on the machine right before it blew. I portaled us out, but the shockwave knocked us... somewhere..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_2,"I'm trying to trace our path through the timelines to see which dimension we're in. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_3,You can do that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_4,Yeah. I'm a genius.\nI can do lots of things.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_INTRO_5,"What about kneeling before me? Let's see if all of you can do that. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_START_0,"Okay, we're in a dimension ruled by Thanos, which narrows it down a little bit..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_START_1,Are there a lot of those?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_START_2,"Not every world has a S.T.R.I.K.E. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_START_3,"Well, this one does now. Take him down. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_END_0,Thanos's forces keep coming! Do we have a way out of here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_04_END_1,"Maybe? I'm not sure. Yes? I'm going to try something a little different. Hold on, everyone!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_0,Everyone here? Everyone still have all their limbs and most of their eyes?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_1,Oof... What was that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_2,I mapped the timestreams and saw a nearby dimension without Thanos and used my E.X.I.L.E. tech to shift us over.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_3,"I've never taken that many people at once before, though. Glad to see it worked. Neat. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_4,"Yeah, neat! I'm gonna go throw up now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_5,"Okay, we're free of Thanos. What's happening in this dimension?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_6,"According to my maps, it should be a world run by the Inhumans."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_7,Intruders! Bow before Black Bolt or be destroyed!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_INTRO_8,"Okay... Apparently, they're EVIL Inhumans. Good to know. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_START_1,"Lord Black Bolt says you cannot win. So surrender, and your death may be swift!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_END_0,"I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Thanos."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_END_1,"We need to get out of here, STAT. Kestrel, tell me you've got a place for us to go. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_END_2,"I need more time to run some calculations, otherwise, we might portal right into another mess. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_END_3,What we need is a way to distract these Inhumans.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_05_END_4,"Oh, a distraction? That I think I can do."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_INTRO_0,Inhumans? Curious. I crushed the last Inhuman under my heel eons ago.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_INTRO_1,The Mad Titan returns? Black Bolt's voice reduced you to dust. He shall do it again.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_INTRO_2,You brought Thanos here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_INTRO_3,"You guys said you wanted a distraction. Now I have enough time to find a way out. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_INTRO_4,"Uh, you just got a little less time - they're turning our way!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_START_0,"These intruders were heralds of Thanos! Prepare to be destroyed. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_MID_0,"You. The interlopers from before. I can destroy you and the Inhumans at once. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_0,Okay! I have our way out. Let's go before Thanos starts throwing moons again.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_1,"You've seen that trick, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_2,"Let's just say I've seen a lot of Earths and not as many moons. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_3,"Great, so... back to Nexus Earth? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_4,"I can't tell you how badly I want to go back, but no. Ultimus has had that power funneled to him."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_06_END_5,He's put cracks in the M'Kraan dimension. And I'm the only one who can seal them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_INTRO_0,"One thing I don't get… How do you know we shut Ultimus inside a M'Kraan Crystal world? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_INTRO_1,"I haven't been able to find my way back to the Nexus, but I've been out here fighting Ultimus like the rest of you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_INTRO_2,"When you took him down, word spread through his corrupted forces in the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_INTRO_3,Knowing S.T.R.I.K.E. was able to stop him and save all those worlds? After I helped to found it? That gave me hope.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_INTRO_4,"We could use a little more hope. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_START_0,This dimension neighbors the M'Kraan world. I can seal the cracks from here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_START_1,"Surely you didn't think Ultimus would leave this place unguarded, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_START_2,"You know, it would have been uncharacteristically considerate of him. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_START_3,"We'll remove you from this place and soon he shall return, and the multiverse will quake!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_END_0,"The first wave of these ex-X-Men are down and out, how are we doing on the whole ""fixing the dimensional barrier"" thing?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_END_1,"Good, the E.X.I.L.E. suit is rebuilding the barrier as we speak."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_END_2,Pretty impressive tech.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_END_3,"Heh, you would say that, Tony - you helped me build it. Well, another you anyway."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_07_END_4,"Glad to be of assistance. Especially when, you know, I didn't have to actually do anything."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_START_0,Another massive wave of Ultimus's mutants incoming!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_START_1,"I'm so close to sealing him in! My instruments are showing him pounding at the walls of his prison. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_START_2,If we don't stop them now...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_START_3,No way. Ultimus stays where he belongs. S.T.R.I.K.E? Take 'em out!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_START_4,"REMEMBER, WHILE KESTREL HAS <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>, ENEMIES CANNOT SUMMON OR CLONE. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_0,"Targets down. Kestrel, tell me we're done here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_1,"I think... Yes, Ultimus is secure. He might be stronger now, but so is his prison."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_2,At least until the next time these acolytes come up with a harebrained scheme.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_3,You think... Ultimus... is the enemy?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_4,You have no idea the chaos he kept at bay... Without him... We return to the survival of the fittest.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_5,"Okay, well, ominous warnings aside, I think it's good he's in space jail! Should we take a vote? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_6,"Let's just get out of here. Kestrel, is that portal our way home?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_7,"Uh, I didn't make that portal. Or that one. Or that one. Oh... Oh no."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_08_END_8,After all this time... We've found you. We have tracked down the Kestrel!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_0,"You've hidden across the stars for too long, Kestrel. Now we'll see you destroyed!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_1,"Um, I'm sorry, I thought you said Ultimus was contained? This is three Ultimuses, which feels very uncontained."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_2,"These aren't Ultimus prime! They're ones looking for revenge on me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_3,"I ran into these versions of Ultimus on my voyage home, and I wasn't exactly helpful."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_4,"I've been dodging them, but all the energy I expended to seal this dimension must have given my position away. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_5,"You revealed where you'd flown, and now we're here to pluck your wings."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_INTRO_6,"Not while we're here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_START_0,"Fury, get your team out of here. Maybe I can hold them off long enough and then slip back into the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_START_1,"Forget it. You helped me found S.T.R.I.K.E., Sybil. You're part of the team."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_START_2,"And we're not losing you again. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_0,"We'll find you again, Kestrel. And then you won't have so many allies to aid you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_1,"We're not going anywhere, ugly. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_2,"Finally, they're gone. Are you ready to head home, Kestrel?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_3,"Honestly? I'm not sure. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_4,"I've seen so many Earths, been lost for so long..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_5,Is Nexus Earth even my home anymore?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_6,"Home's not just where you're from, Sybil. It's the people who need you. Nexus needs you. S.T.R.I.K.E. needs you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_7,And so do I.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KESTREL_09_END_8,"Let's go, Fury. We've got a lot of catching up to do. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_0,"A REMOTE MONASTERY, NEPAL..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_1,"Show yourself, pest! I know you're inside these walls. Your reckoning is at hand. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_2,"Who, little old me? MY reckoning? But I've been such a good boy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_3,"See? Monks? A temple? I'm a zen master now. I've achieved inner peace, instead of my usual\n""outer annoyance."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_4,"Besides, Thanny, I don't really remember actually DOING anything to you reckoning worthy!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_5,"You? No. But in the world I'm from, someone much like you took something precious from me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_6,"So now, across the multiverse, I'm taking something precious from all of the versions of you I can find. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_INTRO_7,Your lives.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_START_0,"Well, Grape Ape, one noble truth I've learned here is that life itself is suffering."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_START_1,"So, come over here, I've got a great big helping of life for you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_START_2,DEFEAT DEADPOOL TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_0,"Okay, fine! I'll tell you my mantra. It's ""UglyTitanSaysWhat."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_1,"More jokes. Once I've finally killed all the Deadpools, the silence will be reward enough. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_2,"No, you're supposed to say ""What?"" and then I finally achieve nirvana! Help a guy out here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_3,"The only help you'll find is death. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_4,"Well, I'm not going to get a better intro line than THAT! Put down the glowy rocks and step away from the Deadpool. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_5,"You. The cosmic mistake. You're too late to save this one, just like all the others. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_6,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_7,"NO! Thanos... Obviously, ""death"" is my whole thing but BOY am I going to love killing you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_8,"You're not getting away again! Let's see how those stones like a little scythe magic! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_01_END_9,No! There's no telling what could hap---
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_0,"NEXUS EARTH, A CORRUPTED STRONGHOLD..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_1,"These corrupted aren't going down easy! Take 'em out fast, team, but remember: non-lethal force only."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_2,"Cable-san, you know that once my katana has been drawn... It may not be returned until it has tasted blood... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_3,For the honor of clan X-Force!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_4,"You let him stay up watching samurai movies again, didn't you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_INTRO_5,"Could be worse. He wanted to watch musicals. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_START_0,"Ultimus may be gone, but we're carrying on his cause! Die, S.T.R.I.K.E.!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_0,"Nate, we got a portal opening up! Reinforcements? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_1,"Oof, my head. Thanos? Is he here yet?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_2,"Woah, woah, who is THIS! She's wearing my outfit?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_3,I know I was doing a samurai thing but that doesn't mean you can steal a guy's gimmick.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_4,"Okay, you're still alive! Cool. Let's keep you that way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_5,"DEATHPOOL'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> CLEARS HER NEGATIVE EFFECTS, HEALING HERSELF AND DEALING DAMAGE FOR EACH EFFECT REMOVED."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_MID_6,"HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> TRANSFERS NEGATIVE EFFECTS FROM DEATHPOOL TO HER TARGET, BEFORE SPREADING THEM TO OTHER ENEMIES."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_0,"Nice moves, kid. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_1,"Hey! Don't praise her! I didn't license out my look! Unless you count Kidpool. And Headpool. And Pandapool. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_2,My name's Deathpool.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_3,"I'm still mad at you, so I refuse to admit that sounds pretty cool! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_4,"And I'm your daughter. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_02_END_5,"Wait, WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_0,"-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_1,"Well, not YOUR daughter, relax. My dad was a Deadpool who fell in love with Death..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_2,"Hm, you must be from a universe where she returned my calls. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_3,"(Actually, now that I think about it, I'm not 100% sure Death even HAS a phone.)"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_4,"From what he told me, he just refused to die. And every time they met, they fell more in love. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_5,"And then one day? I appeared, dope scythe, cool cape, and everything!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_6,"And she let you play with that big knife?! I mean, I would let you, sure, I'm irresponsible. But your mom?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_INTRO_7,"My mom...? I never knew her.\nShe vanished. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_START_0,"DEATHPOOL'S HOME DIMENSION, THREE YEARS AGO..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_START_1,"Their love brought me into the universe, but she vanished! Pretty rude, honestly!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_START_2,"But Dad did what he could, and taught me how to fight. With his own specific style, too. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_START_3,We fought space pirates...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_MID_01_0,...killer robots...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_MID_02_0,"...and generally whoever! I had great power, and Dad always told me it came with great irresponsbility. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_0,Sniff... That... That sounds so beautiful! What happened?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_1,"Thanos. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_2,"I guess he was some lame old boyfriend of mom's?\nExes, am I right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_3,"(I don't actually know, I just joined the cosmic miasma of existence a little bit ago.)"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_4,"But when she vanished, he snapped. Er, I mean he went crazy. He used the Infinity Stones to kill Dad."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_5,But it wasn't enough. He used the Infinity Gauntlet to escape me and has been killing Deadpools across the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_6,"GASP! And you came here to SAVE me?! To protect your new papa?!\nI'm so PROUD. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_03_END_7,"Sure! That'll be a nice side effect! Mainly? I'm going to kill Thanos. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_0,KILL Thanos?! No daughter of mine is going on a revenge quest! Those never end well.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_1,"1. I'm not your daughter!\n2. Don't you kill people, like, kind of a lot?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_2,"Do as I say, not as I do! That's parenting 101! I'm already crushing this. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_3,"My point is, revenge is a big no-no in the hero game! You may as well start calling yourself Punishpool!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_4,"Or the Deathisher? Either way, the skull motif would be redundant. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_5,"I'm not letting you out of my sight until I manage to impart that fatherly wisdom. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_6,"Okay, well, I'm not letting YOU out of my sight. Because Thanos is out there and you're... You know... Bait? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_INTRO_7,"I'll take it! Now come on, Fury's got a mission for me, and it's officially Take Your Deathpool to Work Day."

ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_START_1,"OMG, it's my girl's first day at school! Let's get a selfie to commemorate the occasion!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_START_2,"Okay, but not because we're bonding! It's because the lighting in this bunker is surprisingly great?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_START_3,"Say ""Picture Day Laser Background""! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_START_4,DEFEAT THE ENEMY OPERATORS TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_OPERATOR_01_0,We're under attack! Seal these intruders in with us. We'll deal with them once they're captured.

ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_OPERATOR_03_0,They're almost trapped in here! Who's ready to teach these new recruits some lessons in pain?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_LOSE_0,"Energy field at 100%. You're mine, now. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_END_0,"Wow, first day at school and graduation day all on the same day!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_END_1,"I don't know if it counts as ""graduation"" just because we blew the building up?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_END_2,Then why did you throw your hat in the air as we walked away from the explosion in slow motion?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_END_3,"For STYLE POINTS, obvi!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_04_END_4,Sniff... It's true what they say...\nThey grow up so fast!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_0,I've missed so many big milestones! Tell me about your first steps! Did you keep any of your baby teeth?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_1,"I wasn't ever a baby. If you want teeth, though, I can totally get you teeth."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_2,"Uh... that's okay, I'm good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_3,"Deadpool, this is Fury. Uncharacteristically good work on Taskmaster. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_4,"I'm trying to be a good role model. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_5,"Well, keep it up. There's symbiote activity in the area and you're the closest S.T.R.I.K.E. agent."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_6,Take care of it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_INTRO_7,GASP! The perfect thing - your first PET!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_START_0,"Okay, take your time and pick one out. Don't just fall in love with the first symbiote that runs up to you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_START_1,RAAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_START_2,I'm not sure that's going to be a problem!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_END_0,"No! Bad! Bad Venom! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_05_END_1,"You know, I'm starting to suspect some of these symbiotes aren't even house trained."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_INTRO_0,"See, isn't this fun, us bonding? Want to climb up onto my shoulders? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_INTRO_1,"Hmm, that does sound fun... Wait, no! We're not bonding, okay?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_INTRO_2,"I'm keeping you safe until Thanos shows up to kill you, then I'm killing him? And then I'm heading home. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_INTRO_3,"Now get behind me, there's symbiotes that need a little taste of scythe!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_INTRO_4,"Come back here! We're not done discussing this, young lady! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_START_0,"We will slice and dice you until you're bite-sized! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_START_1,"SOMEONE'S got a bad attitude! You'll calm down a bit once we have you ""fixed."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_START_2,You're going to look SO cute with one of those big cones around your neck!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_0,"Okay, a pet was the wrong call. I know! I can teach you to ride a bike! Where'd Ghost Rider put his training wheels..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_1,"Enough! I know you look like my dad, but you're not him!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_2,"Do you know how many versions of my dad I watched Thanos kill?\nI lost track. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_3,"And as the avatar of death, I'm going to get revenge for all of them. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_4,Uncharacteristically serious advice alert: killing Thanos for revenge is a pretty dark path.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_5,"I don't know your Deadpool, but I don't think it's what he'd want for you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_6,"And I can't be THAT different than him. More handsome, of course..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_7,"More annoying, for sure."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_06_END_8,"Well... being annoying is the main requirement for being a dad. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_INTRO_0,"Deadpool, it's Fury. Something's entering the atmopshere fast, looks like Thanos's forces have finally found you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_INTRO_1,Heeeeeeeeey! You knew he was coming for me?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_INTRO_2,Of course I knew. We've been preparing for this fight since Spooky over there popped into our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_INTRO_3,"Why do you think I got you out of the way with that busy work? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_INTRO_4,"BUSY WORK?! Well, I never! You think you know a guy! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_START_0,"Surrender your Deadpool, and our master will leave the rest of this world alive."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_START_1,"You have no idea how tempting that deal is. But it's still a no. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_START_2,"Prepare the charges! Destroy this planet, and leave nothing left!"

ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,"You lost the moment you chose to stand before the might of Thanos. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_END_0,"Okay, Big Purp! You had all this extra time to prepare, and we still took out your army!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_END_1,"Come on out, you've got a date with me! By which I mean death! But not in a romantic way, in a destiny way!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_07_END_2,"Don't you know? I AM destiny. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_0,"Your scythe interferred with my Space Stone, and sent me halfway across this wretched universe."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_1,"But I cannot be denied. I found my way back to this cosmic blight, this joke who took your mother from me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_2,"Uh, that's Mister Cosmic Blight to you, pal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_3,"Well, Mr. Fate, only one thing you failed to consider when you crashed my home dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_4,"Oh? Tell me, what's that? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_5,We have a Thanos.\nAnd he works for me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_INTRO_6,"Let's see how inevitable you really are. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_START_0,"Are you going to be able to fight alongside me without trouble, child? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_START_1,"As long as we kill my Thanos, who am I to look a gift titan in the mouth?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_0,"You've traveled the multiverse, why? To destroy him? You shame us both with this pettiness. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_1,I'm beyond shame. I'm beyond pain. I simply want one thing - my vengeance!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_2,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_3,Your Thanos doesn't know what it is to be sharpened by such single-minded purpose.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_4,To be fueled by revenge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_08_END_5,"But you do. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_0,"Look at you, lost in this multiverse. Driven only by your hatred for me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_1,"Um, DUH? I have NOT been shy about that fact. You kind of killed my DAD, dude!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_2,"And dozens like him. What's one more? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_3,"You'd stop at nothing to kill me. So, you know better than anyone else that you can't stop me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_4,Don't listen to him! You're better than him! And I'm not just saying this because I very much want to live!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_INTRO_5,"I'm sorry, Da... Deadpool. I didn't cross the multiverse to let this guy off with a warning!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_START_0,"Finally, we'll settle this! I destroy you both and right a cosmic wrong, or you kill me! Either way, my work is complete!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_START_1,"YEESH, this guy never stops talking! Yap yap ya- wait..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_START_2,"Is THIS what it's like talking to me?! No wonder Fury's always so crabby. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_0,"Heh... So... your hatred won out over mine. Now kill me, and end this."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_1,Wait! Just a second! No one's going to miss this big purple pile of goop! Least of all me!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_2,But take it from someone whose parents are DEFINITELY disappointed in him - this isn't who they'd want you to be.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_3,"UGH! I can't believe it, but... you're right."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_4,"Death is a natural, beautiful part of life - I mean look at me, I'm gorgeous!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_5,"But this isn't justice for my dad. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_6,I'll bring Thanos back to our dimension. Let a certain cosmic Tribunal pass judgement!\nSee how he likes THAT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_7,"Well, I guess now that my life isn't in MORTAL DANGER anymore, I won't be seeing you around here much..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_8,"Don't worry, I'm sure plenty of people want to kill you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_9,"I'll be back soon... Dadpool. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATHPOOL_09_END_10,"GASP!!!! DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_0,"THE SANCTUM SANCTORUM, NEW YORK..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_1,Fellow sorcerers... I have news.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_2,"You vanished, Morgan. And now you reappear, gathering us here with whispers. Speak.  "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_3,"To the point as ever, Harkness. I knew I liked some part of you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_4,"It's true, I did slip away, and I did so in search of a way to get my revenge. On you, especially, Maximoff."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_INTRO_5,"But I called you here because what I found... Was far more terrifying than any demon I could have conjured. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_0,"In my hubris, I unleashed something ancient. A being that seeks to use my power for its own purposes."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_1,"And now you want us to get you out of this mess? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_2,"I've mastered demons, fought kings, and taught gods. If this being scares me, ask yourselves - what other chaos is it capable of?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_3,"But there's a ritual, deep in the pages of the Darkhold. With our powers, we can use the book to destroy this enemy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_4,"Why should we trust anything you say, Le Fay?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_5,"We don't need to trust her. My mastery of the Darkhold binds her to me. She won't be able to cast a spell against us. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_6,"If this thing is as terrible as you say, we have no choice but to investigate. What's the first step of the ritual?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_01_END_7,To venture where I first brought the pages of the Darkhold together - the caverns beneath Mount Wundagore!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_0,"You know, when I first decided to study the mystic arts, I thought there would be more grandeur and fewer musty caverns. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_1,"Why this place, Le Fay?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_2,"The Darkhold contains spells and rituals of the great demon Chthon. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_3,"When I bound it, I had to trap the demon's soul not just in the book but in this place as well."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_4,"The mountain is now the center of the book's power. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_5,You bound a demon that easily... And yet this new enemy frightens you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_INTRO_6,Perhaps it's time you told us more about them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_0,"When I looked to free myself from your grasp, I heard this voice call to me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_1,"And as I followed it, it burrowed deeper into my soul. Felt its hands on my mystic power. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_2,"It's not a demon, not a god. Something just as old, though. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_3,"I thought I could use it, but it's clear it uses me. So I called you all. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_4,"Here. We've reached the heart of the mountain. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_02_END_5,Let the ritual begin.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_0,"Le Fay? Morgan? No response - this is as deep a trance as I've ever seen. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_1,"I don't like any of this, Wanda. An unknown enemy, dark magic? There are too many uncontrolled elements. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_2,"I'd think you'd be comfortable with dark magic at this point, Stephen. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_3,"All my experience with forbidden magic has brought me an abundance of caution, not comfort. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_4,"Caution, I understand. We're not just letting Morgan cast a spell unaltered. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_5,"While she's casting this spell, I've begun one of my own."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_INTRO_6,One to let us see exactly what we're dealing with.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_0,"Careful, Wanda... Interrupting the magic of the Darkhold is dangerous."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_1,"I'm not interrupting the Darkhold, I'm flowing through it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_2,We'll see into Morgan's mind while she's connected to the book. Watch and learn.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_3,"O, MISTS OF MORPHEUS. PART THE VEIL BETWEEN THE HIDDEN AND THE REAL. SHOW US WHAT WE NEED. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_4,Wanda... Whispers and visions... What are we seeing? Feeling?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_5,"Morgan's mind is twisted, I'm only getting glimpses... A massive figure, purple and blue. Heat... Dry heat? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_6,"Overwhelming evil, but also... the sense that we've faced this enemy before? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_03_END_7,Wanda... The spell... it's doing something... H-HELP ME!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_0,ARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_1,What's happened?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_2,"Strange's demons, the ones he's bound to himself, they're bursting out of him! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_3,It's the mountain... They're too powerful here!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_4,"I feared this could happen. I'm attempting to bind ancient evil... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_5,And ancient evil is what this Strange is full of. Wonderful.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_INTRO_6,We can't let these demons disrupt the ritual. Stop them at all costs!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_0,"I've... Returned the demons to my service... Thank you all. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_1,"Of course, Stephen. Now we can deal with the real problem - Le Fay. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_2,"Finally caught on, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_3,"Stephen's demons didn't free themselves - your spell did it. Instead of trapping ancient evil, this ritual RELEASES it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_4,"But my power over the Darkhold still controls you, Le Fay. Surrender before I have to use it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_04_END_5,"I'm afraid you're far, far too late for that, little Witch. I'm free. FREE!!!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_0,"The Darkhold, my control of it... You... Shattered! How?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_1,"I was telling the truth about that ancient evil, Witch. It did call to me. But I EMBRACED it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_2,His power combined with mine allowed me to break free of your control without you suspecting a thing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_3,"And with this ritual, I've broken your grasp on the Darkhold! The book is mine again!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_4,"We stopped you once not long ago, Morgan. What makes you think it'll go differently now?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_5,"Because I have embraced my destiny. You dragged me to this time and I hated you for it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_6,"But thanks to your interference, I've found this new power! And I can use it to destroy you..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_INTRO_7,As a horseman of Apocalypse!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_0,"Apocalypse?! But we locked him away. I saw Strange and the X-Men do it years ago. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_1,"True, his barriers were enough to keep out the strongest sorcerers of your age. But I am not from your age. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_2,"I freed Apocalypse, and he's rewarded me by reuniting me with the Darkhold. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_3,The true strength of which I can show you now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_4,My... Mind... What are you doing to my mind?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_5,"First, I'll bend you to the will of the Darkhold. Then, I'll return to my master. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_6,"And his empire will spread across the multiverse, unstoppable and unrelenting."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_MORGAN_05_END_7,"Soon, you and S.T.R.I.K.E. will know what it is to experience Apocalypse, thanks to me... His horseman of Pestilence!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_0,"THE X-MANSION, UPSTATE NEW YORK..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_1,"Whew! Ah tell ya, sugah, somethin' about this latest round of Corrupted baddies? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_2,Kickin' their butt takes it outta you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_3,"You'd t'ink they'd be easier, wit' Ultimus an' Doom gone. But you're right, cherie - they're worked up about somet'ing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_4,"Either way, ah'm exhausted. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_5,"Forty winks is exactly what this southern belle needs to be fresh as a dang daisy. If y'all need me, ah'll be in bed. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_6,"Perhaps you need a li'l company, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_INTRO_7,"Nice try, handsome. This is a solo mission."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_0,"Ugh, ah'm too wound up from all that brawlin', couldn't catch a single Z."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_1,"Hello? Y'all? Anyone here? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_2,"I sent the students away, Rogue. For their own protection."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_3,"Scott? What's going on? Protection from what? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_4,"From you, Rogue. Whether you know it or not, you're a danger to everyone. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_5,"I told you that you couldn't trust her, Summers. Not after what she did to me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_6,"Carol? That... That was a long, long time ago. Ah told you how sorry ah was..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_01_END_7,I need you to stand down. Or we'll take you down.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_0,"Ah don't understand... Why are y'all doing this? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_1,We were wrong to take you in. You've been a member of the X-Men...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_2,"An Avenger... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_3,"But you'll always be a villain at your core. It's your nature.  "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_4,You can't even get close to someone without hurting them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_5,"And we let you get close to us.\nBig mistake. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_6,"Ah'm not going to stand here and let y'all say the years we spent side-by-side mean nothin'! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_INTRO_7,"Y'all want to bring me down, it won't be without a fight!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_END_0,"We... We told you... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_END_1,"You'll be... The end of us all... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_END_2,Y'all forced me into this fight! Ah didn't want to do this!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_END_3,Hurting my friends... what the heck am ah doing?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_02_END_4,The right thing! But this fight isn't over yet. Come with me quick!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_0,"Mystique, you need to believe me, ah didn't mean to hurt anyone. Ah'm not even sure what's HAPPENIN'. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_1,"It's okay, sweetheart. I'm here now. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_2,"These X-Men, these Avengers, S.T.R.I.K.E., they were never going to fully embrace you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_3,"What? But... They did, they were my family..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_4,"I was your family, too. And you betrayed me. But I'm welcoming you back to where you belong..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_5,With the Brotherhood.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_INTRO_6,No. No! Ah'm not goin' back to that life! And y'all can't make me!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_0,"You spoiled brat. Your friends turn on you, and I graciously save you AGAIN?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_1,And this is how you repay me?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_2,"Ah'm grateful for everything y'all did for me, Raven. But y'all used me..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_3,Like the weapon you are. That's all you're ever going to be.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_4,That ain't true!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_5,"Oh, but it is... Me, Xavier, Fury...\nJust point you at something and watch you destroy it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_6,NO! STOP IT! AH'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SAY THAT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_7,AHHH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_03_END_8,Mystique?! No... No... Ah... Ah killed her?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_0,Ah can't believe it... What have ah done. Raven... Maybe they're all right.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_1,"Maybe ah'm a danger to everyone. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_2,"Dat ain't true, cherie."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_3,Remy? Stay away from me! Ah'm a monster.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_4,"You ain't. I saw what you did to Mystique, and it wasn't your fault. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_5,"Anything in you dat ain't good, she put there. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_INTRO_6,"Gambit's here by your side, no matter what. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_0,Where are all these enemies comin' from?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_1,"No idea, but we can handle it, cherie. We'll get someplace safe an' figure it out together."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_2,"Thanks for remindin' me that ah'm more than what other people say, sugah. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_3,"Anytime, Rogue. I just wish... I... Help... Help me... So weak..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_4,Remy?! What's happenin' to you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_04_END_5,"That would be me, sugah."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_0,Who are you?! What did you do to Remy?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_1,"Why darlin', don't you recognize me? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_2,Ah'm you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_3,"Oh, ah ain't that ugly. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_4,"Ha. I'm what you could be if you embrace your powers.\nI'm you at our fittest. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_5,I'm the you meant to serve Apocalypse!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_6,"Ah'm done listenin' to voices like yours. You want me to show you what mah powers can do? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_INTRO_7,YOU GOT IT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_0,That... That all... y'all got?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_1,A valiant effort. But you lost this battle before you knew it began.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_2,"Your tenacity will serve me well. When the time is right. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_3,No! No! Ahhh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_4,"Rogue?! Rogue, are you okay?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_5,"Scott? What's going on? Is Remy okay?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_6,Gambit's fine! He's in the Danger Room. I'm worried about YOU. You were screaming in your sleep.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_7,"A... A dang DREAM?! It felt so real, Scott. And awful. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_8,"It's okay. Catch your breath. Then, I need you to meet me in the hangar. Fury got some intel, and we need to go."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_ROGUE_05_END_9,"It's Apocalypse. He's back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_0,"What gives, Ock? You said this device was supposed to be our way home!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_1,Octavius tech was the key to getting me home the last time I was stuck in this era. It should work.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_2,"Patience, Spiders. You cannot comprehend the... Anomalies I'm dealing with. Yes, lots of anomalies."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_3,I smell a rat.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_4,"Ya'at'eeh, brothers in arms. You're both far from your homes."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_5,"Don't move, kid! You one of Ock's goons?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_6,"I'm Spider-Weaver, the protector of the Web of Life and Destiny, something you two have got in quite a tangle."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_INTRO_7,Good news! My device is finally ready. Ready to squash all three of you bugs at once!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_START_0,This quack isn't going to get you anywhere.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_START_1,"You thought I'd help YOU?! The fewer Spiders there are in the multiverse, the better!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_START_2,SPIDER-WEAVER IS A PROTECTOR WHO USES <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color> TO HELP HER ALLIES STAY IN THE FIGHT.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_START_3,HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> AND <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> DEAL DAMAGE WHILE MANIPULATING STATUS EFFECTS AND GIVING HERSELF <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_START_4,"HER <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> DEALS MASSIVE DAMAGE, WITH EXTRA <color=#fff568>PIERCING</color> BONUS ATTACKS THE CLOSER SPIDER-WEAVER IS TO FULL HEALTH!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_0,"Drop the gag, Octavius! Tell us what you know!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_1,"Octavius was never going to be able to get you home. The thing blocking your paths is mystical, not scientific. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_2,"But lucky for you both, I can help."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_3,Oh yeah? How?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_4,These legs help me traverse universes using the Web of Life and Destiny.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_5,"I can take you with me, but this magic is powerful. I'll need your help to uncover and stop the source."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_6,My old lab was under attack when I was brought here. Do you think that's connected?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_01_END_7,"Only one way to find out. Your thread may be tangled, but I can still trace it back to 2099. Let's go."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_0,"MIGUEL O'HARA'S LAB, THE YEAR 2099..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_1,"Your lab is trashed. Looks like someone threw one heck of a party. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_2,DAMN! The blueprints to the Alchemex Transformation Chamber were stolen!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_3,Who could be after them? And how would they be able to bar you from returning to your time?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_4,You're the Web of Life expert. You've seen a tangle like this before?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_5,"My grandmother. Navajo weavers have a special connection to the Web and can safeguard it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_6,She was the teacher for our current weavers. Someone targeted her to get at the other weavers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_INTRO_7,Altse! There's movement! Someone's still here!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_START_0,Find what you're looking for?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_START_1,He's back! Get him!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_0,"Team 2, come in! Where are you guys? We're waiting on you! Over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_1,"Hold on, I've ALWAYS wanted to do this."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_2,*AHEM* We got lost! Where should we be meeting again?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_3,"Seriously? I'm not going to tell the boss you said that, she'd kill you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_4,Idiot! We're at Alchemax HQ. Now hurry!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_02_END_5,"I kind of can't believe that worked. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_0,"This place is heavily guarded, even for us."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_1,"Luckily, I know another way in."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_2,We've got the blueprints. Time to head home.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_3,We're too late. She has the blueprints.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_4,"""When you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, strike first."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_INTRO_5,Looks like we weren't the only spies. GET THEM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_START_0,You have no idea how dangerous that machine is!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_START_1,You have no idea how dangerous I am!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_END_0,These blueprints could've created hundreds of genetically modified villains.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_END_1,Good thing we stopped them. I'll leave the plans in your capable hands.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_END_2,"More importantly, your thread in the Web of Life and Destiny is no longer entangled."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_END_3,"Thanks for your help. If you need anything, don't hesitate to drop in."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_03_END_4,"Ahehee', my friend. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_0,"NEXUS EARTH, A HEATED BATTLE BETWEEN SPIDER-MAN (NOIR) AND... HIS PUZZLE CUBE?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_1,One down... Five sides to go...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_2,What are you doing?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_3,"Uh, nothing! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_4,"Oooookay... Well, Miguel is sorted out, now we can go to your home. But where to start?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_5,"The Goblin's got his finger on the criminal pulse in this city. He's going to be searching for something. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_INTRO_6,And I know exactly where to look for it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_START_0,Just the cronies I was looking for.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_START_1,This is the Goblin's crew? I don't know why I expected actual goblins.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_START_2,"I ain't tellin' ya nothin', ya hear?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_0,"Okay, okay, I'll talk."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_1,I'm waiting.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_2,Goblin's got a new dame as his partner.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_3,They're planning on hitting the museum tonight.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_4,Which museum?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_5,He knows which one.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_04_END_6,"The Museum of Natural History. Of course. We gotta beat feet, now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_0,Doesn't look like they're here yet. Why would they target this museum?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_1,It's because of me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_2,The totem that unleashed a swarm of spiders on me also gave me my powers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_3,"It broke, but the pieces are still here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_4,"First, Alchemax's blueprints and now your totem..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_5,"The past and future threads are being affected. This time, weavers aren't the targets."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_6,I'm afraid of what this will lead to.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_INTRO_7,You can think about that later. The party just arrived.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_END_0,That was the last of them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_END_1,I thought their boss would've been with them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_END_2,"She's gotta be hiding out somewhere. We'll flush her out. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_05_END_3,Don't be so impatient. You'll be my prisoners soon enough!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_INTRO_0,"We just came for the totem, but bringing back the actual Spider-Man? I do like earning extra credit. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_INTRO_1,You will have to get through me first!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_INTRO_2,"K'ad, face me and your fate!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_START_0,STOP THEM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_0,Beating me means nothing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_1,Do you know what SHE'LL do to you if we fail?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_2,"Another cog in the machine, huh? Who's pulling the crank?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_3,The Darkchylde. And she will send more of her army after you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_4,"Darkchylde? Please, tell me we aren't going up against an actual kid."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_5,She's no child. She's a sorcerer called Magik.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_6,"She tried meddling with the Web before. I taught her why that's a bad idea. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_06_END_7,Looks like she needs to relearn that lesson.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_0,"Okay, we need to find Magik before... Wait. Something is very wrong."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_1,Wrong? But you just said you needed to find me. And now here I am. Why don't we go somewhere and talk?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_2,"No! Noir, watch out, she's teleporting us..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_3,To my domain. Welcome to Limbo!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_4,"Good luck untangling your precious Web from here, Weaver."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_INTRO_5,"Once it's fully tainted, my master and I will be free to travel and rule the multiverse!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_START_0,Come down here and fight me yourself!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_START_1,"Hm, what's the point of having mystical minions if they can't fight your battles for you? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_END_0,"You beat my mystics, but with every passing second, the effects of Limbo will wear you down."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_END_1,Your friends are already struggling.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_END_2,Underestimating me again? Bring. It. ON!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_07_END_3,It's going to be fun to watch you break.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_START_0,Demons! Here's a new chew toy!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_START_1,There is no end to these creatures.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_START_2,I should be able to get out if I can get a second to breathe...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_END_0,"Finally, an opening!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_END_1,"Nice of you to join us, kid."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_END_2,Now we can get overrun together. Fantastic.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_END_3,"I know I can get us out, but not until we take out Magik. She's doing too much damage to the Web. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_08_END_4,One Queen of the Damned coming right up.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_INTRO_0,What makes you think you can stand against me?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_INTRO_1,"Because I am the protector of the Web of Life and Destiny, and my spirit does NOT falter!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_INTRO_2,I WILL defend every thread's connection.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_INTRO_3,And you will know my power!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_START_0,"Your mistake was targeting my kin and thinking I wouldn't notice. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_START_1,Prepare yourself!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_0,"Great job, kid. I'm glad you're on our side."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_1,You've stopped nothing. You have no idea what's on the horizon.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_2,"Yeah, yeah. There's always something on the horizon. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_3,"His reign is inevitable! You will see. Until then... So long, Spiders!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_4,"Wait, she's... Damn, she teleported away!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_5,Seems like you'll have your hands full soon.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_6,"Whenever you need us, we'll be there."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_7,"Thanks, friends. I worry we won't be the only targets of whatever calamity she says is coming."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERWEAVER_09_END_8,"But for now, this place is giving me the heebie-jeebies! I'll make sure we're all home for dinner."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_INTRO_0,"I know this is a dream, but it feels so real."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_INTRO_1,Nakia!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_INTRO_2,Who... what are you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_END_0,"You are worthy, Nakia."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_END_1,Wakanda is in danger.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_END_2,In danger? What do you mean?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_01_END_3,Seek out Natasha Romanoff.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_0,...You want more?! Okay… if you insist…
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_1,"No! No! No! I'll tell you anything, just don't-"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_2,Natasha!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_3,Nakia? What are you doing here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_4,I need your help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_INTRO_5,It will have to wait. My friend here has some new visitors that just walked in...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_0,"So, are you going to disappear on me like your other spy friends?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_1,What are you talking about?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_2,"I've been coordinating with various War Dogs, but they all started ghosting me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_3,That's not like us. Something is wrong. Where was your most recent contact?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_4,New York. We were about to make an exchange there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_02_END_5,Then we must go there. I will show you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_INTRO_0,"We were using this alley as our dead drop location, but then my contact went silent."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_INTRO_1,Their cover must have been compromised.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_INTRO_2,War Dogs are highly discreet. They are not exposed so easily.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_INTRO_3,"Well, somebody knew he was here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_INTRO_4,And I think we're about to find out who…
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_END_0,"Nakia, our War Dogs around the globe are being hunted."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_END_1,By whom?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_END_2,"We don't know, but we do have a lead."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_END_3,Our tracking systems are showing that the equipment stolen from your location is now being moved to the nearby docks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_03_END_4,Heading there now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_INTRO_0,This stuff is heavy!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_INTRO_1,Stop your whinin' and get those boxes on the boat!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_INTRO_2,Those belong to Wakanda. Put them down!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_INTRO_3,"Lady, the only thing that's going to get put down is you!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_END_0,We have recovered the stolen equipment. They are seeking Vibranium!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_04_END_1,I was afraid of that. Recover what you can.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_INTRO_0,They know our every move it seems. We must be extra careful.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_INTRO_1,"Nakia, you could be the target of one of these attacks. Watch your back."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_INTRO_2,"Well, that was easy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_INTRO_3,The boss said that she'd show up at the docks. And here she is!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_INTRO_4,Hand over the Vibranium! Or join your other War Dog friends.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_05_END_0,"Nakia, some of them are splitting off trying to escape! I'm going after them!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_INTRO_0,"Hold it right there, Kingpin!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_INTRO_1,"Oh no! It's an ""Avenger""!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_INTRO_2,"I'm not scared of you, Widow. The people I'm working with now are way out of your league."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_INTRO_3,And they happen to want this shiny Vibranium.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_INTRO_4,...which I'm about to take from you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_END_0,"Nice work, but things have taken a turn for the worse."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_END_1,We have reports of an underground base right here on the edge of Wakanda.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_END_2,How is this possible?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_06_END_3,I do not know. But we could use your infiltration skills.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_INTRO_0,Welcome to our new Vibranium mining facility!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_INTRO_1,Mining facility?!  You do not belong here in Wakanda!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_INTRO_2,Are you sure about that? One of your people invited us here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_INTRO_3,No Wakandan would allow this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_INTRO_4,Can I please punch the smirk off this guy's face now?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_END_0,Who would let them in here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_END_1,Me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_07_END_2,Okoye?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_INTRO_0,I'm not the Okoye of this world. I am bound to serve MY Wakanda... and our greater ruler.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_INTRO_1,"""Greater ruler""? Wakanda serves no one!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_INTRO_2,"It is nothing personal, Nakia. We just need all your Vibranium."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_INTRO_3,I'm not betraying my own people like you have.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_INTRO_4,You are just as stubborn as the other War Dogs that I have put to rest.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_END_0,I cannot believe that Wakandans from ANY universe would bow to someone else.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_END_1,"That is because you know little beyond your borders. I, Namor, am the ruler of my world."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_END_2,"Our Wakanda fell long ago, and the Vibranium scraped clean from its belly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_END_3,My path to becoming even more powerful is simple: acquire more Vibranium.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_08_END_4,"I would like to personally invite you to meet me here in Japan, so we can discuss how you can help me achieve this goal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_0,Thank you for coming and entertaining my request on such short notice.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_1,There is nothing to discuss.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_2,Nakia! He is holding me captive until you help him. Please do as he asks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_3,T'Challa?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_4,"See, Nakia? Perhaps we do have something to discuss."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_5,"Don't trust him, Nakia!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_6,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_7,"I am sorry, T'Challa. Whatever Namor has done to you, it is too late."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_INTRO_8,Wakanda Forever!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_START_0,"I told you, she isn't so easily deceived!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_START_1,No matter. Get rid of her so we can resume operations.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_END_0,"Thank you, Natasha, for all that you have done. Wakanda is in debt to you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NAKIA_09_END_1,The War Dogs have helped me out of many bad situations. There is no debt.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_0,"Listen up, S.T.R.I.K.E. While we've been fighting small fires, I've been keeping my eye open for the next big one."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_1,"And unfortunately, we've found it. Apocalypse is back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_2,How'd that happen? Doctor Strange and the X-Men sealed him away for good years ago. I was there.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_3,"Morgan Le Fay freed him, using ancient magics that not even we had access to. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_4,"Now Le Fay's powers are amplified by Apocalypse... The Scarlet Witch and I barely escaped our battle with her. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_5,If Le Fay wields his power...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_6,"He's collecting Horsemen again. We need to find him before he gets the full set. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_7,"But we have no leads, so that means this is an old-fashioned manhunt."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_INTRO_8,"I want every S.T.R.I.K.E. agent investigating every disturbance. Kick down doors. Find Apocalypse. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_0,"Fury, a word. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_1,"What is it, Ross? If this is about Banner, I do not have time for it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_2,"Sending us after any idiot in a costume that makes trouble is a good way to cast a net. But we can be smarter. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_3,"If I were amassing an army under your nose, I'd be quiet. Dead quiet. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_4,"So we look for the places where there isn't anything happening. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_5,"Exactly. Look - Symkaria. Normally a hotbed of action. Now? Nothing. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_01_END_6,"Alright, Ross. Take the Gamma Team and go. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_0,"Gamma Team, focus up. We're dropping in five. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_1,"Our target is a bunker on the outskirts of Symkaria. Our scanner says it's pulling enough energy to light up Madripoor. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_2,"We break down the door, find out what they're using that energy for, and turn that bunker into a crater. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_3,"How certain are we that it's Apocalypse's forces? We have no idea what we're walking into. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_4,"What's wrong, Banner? Losing your nerve?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_5,"Something just doesn't seem right. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_INTRO_6,"You're taking orders from me again, Banner. Seems like everything's in its right place to me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_0,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_1,"Knock knock. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_2,It looks... abandoned? What was drawing all that power?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_3,"Just because there's no fight at the entrance doesn't mean this place is empty. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_4,"Brawn, She-Hulk, head down to the lower levels. Banner, you and I will clear this level."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_02_END_5,And don't worry... I've got your back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_0,"All this equipment... It looks like someone WAS here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_1,"Jen, report in. Anything on the lower levels?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_2,"We found what's pulling the energy. Amadeus says it's a transporter. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_3,"Wait... it's firing up... Bruce, get down here! They're coming through, it's--"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_4,Jen?! Jen come in!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_5,"Looks like you were right, Ross. But you walked us right into..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_6,WHAM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_INTRO_7,"Yeah. A trap. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_0,"Rrrrgh... Ross, what are you doing?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_1,"I'm sick of your sanctimony, son. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_2,"You and Fury, telling me what to do while you lacked the grit to get the real job done."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_3,"The Multiverse is in chaos, and you two are too weak to set it right."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_4,Too puny.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_5,"Apocalypse and I are going to do what S.T.R.I.K.E. can't and instill order. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_03_END_6,Right after I smash you into green dust!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_0,Hngh...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_1,"I've been itching to let you have it, Banner!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_2,Argh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_3,Drain the Gamma from you and watch you crumble!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_4,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_5,"Didn't think it was going to be this easy. You're the ""Smart Hulk"", huh? Not smart enough to see this coming, though. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_6,"Maybe not... but... I can think of someone who was. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_INTRO_7,"Thanks for taking the hits, Doctor Banner. We've got it from here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_0,"Fury?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_1,"What, you thought I bought your ""helpful suggestion"" routine for a minute, Ross?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_2,"I trust you about as far as I can throw you, and you weigh half a ton."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_3,"There was no manhunt - just follow you and wait for you to show us where Apocalypse was.\nThanks, by the way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_4,I've got a team on the lower levels helping out She-Hulk and company right now. As for you...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_5,"Thor, help Doctor Banner show this treasonous piece of garbage to the cell I've got waiting for him."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_04_END_6,"Oh, verily. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_0,"RARGH! You think you can hold me? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_1,"Between Thor, the Hulk, and the assorted other heavy hitters in tights I brought? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_2,"Yeah, I figure we can hold you and take care of whatever goons are on the lower levels."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_3,"You forgot one thing, Fury..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_4,What's that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_5,"He's not the only one with friends. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_6,"Le Fay! Get the mystics in here, now! I need... Wait... She's not alone."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_INTRO_7,"Behold the image of your destruction and the world's salvation, Nick Fury. Gaze up on APOCALYPSE!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_0,"Apocalypse is on site! Regroup at the Helicarrier... This fight is just beginning. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_1,Fury and his soldiers... They flee.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_2,"No. It is part of a strategy.\nBut it will not help them. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_3,"You have done well, bringing the enemy to me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_4,"I'm wounded... I'm no good to you this way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_5,Let my power flow through you.\nTake your final form.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_6,"Yes... Yes, I feel it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_7,"The great battle has begun. And for that, I need my general.\nI need my Horseman of WAR!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_REDHULK_05_END_8,RAAAAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_0,"GARDINERS ISLAND, NEW YORK..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_1,Disgusting.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_2,"No matter the universe, these... lesser beings overrun the planet."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_3,Any and all threats to them are handled by their heroes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_4,And you're confident this armor is sufficient for the mission ahead?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_5,Are you doubting my abilities?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_6,"It wouldn't be the first time you've withheld information, McCoy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_INTRO_7,Heh heh... \n This one is unparalleled. Take it for a test spin.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_START_0,Insignificant worms! The time of the Apocalypse is now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_MID_0,You have been deemed inferior and unfit for the world to come.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_END_0,This is the human strength I was warned about?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_END_1,"Clearly, my designs surpassed even my calculations."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_END_2,What a feeble attempt to defy their fate.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_01_END_3,This area has a dense concentration of heroes. Those likely won't be the last.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_INTRO_0,"Hurry, everyone! This way to the evacuation site!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_INTRO_1,I got the word out. Heroes from here to Manhattan are rushing over to help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_INTRO_2,That won't be enough...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_INTRO_3,I thought the bar couldn't get any lower.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_INTRO_4,Leave the weaklings to their fate and live to see the coming of a new age.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_START_0,You're gonna pay for all of this!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_START_1,Then face me and become the fodder for the new world!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_END_0,Evolution was meant to rid Homo Superiors of weaklings. This is proof that it needed a helping hand.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_END_1,Fitting that they would gather like cattle waiting for slaughter.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_END_2,Clinging to those they think to have the strength to defy destiny.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_02_END_3,You will be flushed from the shadows and into the arms of oblivion.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_0,"Hold it, Snowglobe!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_1,No one - and I mean NO ONE - cancels International Chimichanga Day.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_2,You dare to challenge me? Dead Man Wade had more sense. I thought you would share that.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_3,You thought wrong!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_4,Evolution cannot be stopped. No matter how much you struggle against it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_5,Sounds like we got here just in time!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_INTRO_6,Pests.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_START_0,The tools of your annihilation have been handed down to us by the Star Gods.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_START_1,Their power is beyond your comprehension.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_START_2,Enough big talk. I got a fistful of power with your name on it!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_END_0,AHAHAHA. Your flailing makes this all worthwhile.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_END_1,"These Sapiens can kick and scream all they want. In fact, I encourage it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_END_2,WE are the chosen. The Star Gods selected us to clear the way for the world's rightful heirs to take their claim.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_END_3,"Mutants, hear me! Join Apocalypse, and your position in the coming world is secured!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_03_END_4,Any mutant traitors who dare to defend the humans can join them in the rubble.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_0,There are more mutants here than I remember.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_1,Our numbers swelled after the last beating.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_2,Show some restraint next time. I could barely collect any samples.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_3,I know where ya can find more.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_4,Show me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_5,STONY BROOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_6,"This isn't good. The rooms are packed, and we're running out of beds."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_INTRO_7,Let me help to solve your little boarding problem.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_START_0,Take the hospital! Leave none alive!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_END_0,Bringin' this large of a group was overkill.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_END_1,Let the slaughter here serve as a testament to the power of the coming future.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_END_2,"The traitors and their pets flee before us, searching for a new hole to crawl into."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_END_3,I'll sniff 'em out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_04_END_4,"Good. With any luck, even more will be drawn to join us."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_INTRO_0,Cut off that group there! Don't let them escape!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_INTRO_1,"Not so fast, bub!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_INTRO_2,"Weapon X, I should have known you'd eventually show yourself."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_INTRO_3,I shoulda known Victor was helping you start a bloodbath. This ends now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_INTRO_4,Ends? We're only getting started.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_END_0,"Too much for you, Weapon X?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_END_1,Flee before the incredible power given to us by the Star Gods.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_END_2,The Death Seeds ensure a mind focused solely on the task at hand.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_END_3,Which happens to be the fall of man and the destruction of mutants like yourself.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_05_END_4,I will succeed in my mission. \n And Apocalypse will reign supreme!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_INTRO_0,"We got the upper hand now. 'Ro, go left. I'll flank him."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_INTRO_1,I shall not let you down!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_INTRO_2,I'd recognize that stench anywhere. We got company.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_INTRO_3,You've brought friends.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_INTRO_4,What will you do when I make their ashes rain over you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_START_0,"Make your final stand, Weapon X, so I can strike you down once and for all."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_END_0,I ain't the only one you should be worried about.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_END_1,Tin Man's got more than enough firepower to stop you dead in your tracks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_END_2,"HAHAHA! Finally, your interference is at an end."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_END_3,Let the dregs gather their pitiful strength and allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_06_END_4,I'll purge their ranks and this world of their fragility.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_INTRO_0,"Do not cry, little ones. You are safe now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_INTRO_1,You would peddle lies to these children?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_INTRO_2,No one is safe. I will destroy all of humanity.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_INTRO_3,You will have to get through me first.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_INTRO_4,And I will NOT be beaten!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_START_0,Where are Weapon X and Storm? What have you done?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_START_1,"Fret not, you will join them soon."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_END_0,"I told you that you would join them, didn't I?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_END_1,Am I not a man of my word?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_END_2,Let me promise you this: I will find the rest of your treacherous group.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_07_END_3,"And when I do, I will spare no man, woman, or child."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_0,What do we do now?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_1,We regroup! We aren't kids scared of a monster under the bed!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_2,How many times have we faced an indomitable threat and won?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_3,"If the first group attacks here, the second group can catch them unaware."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_4,ARRGGGHHH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_5,What's going on back there?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_6,You had loyal members of your group. Too bad they weren't loyal to you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_INTRO_7,Clear out this rat den.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_END_0,My goal is almost reached.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_END_1,Soon Apocalypse will arrive and begin the transformation of this world.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_08_END_2,All of this straining against the end will be for naught.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_0,"Please, show mercy! I'll do whatever you want!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_1,Then quit your mewling and meet your end.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_2,I will not allow you to continue shedding the blood of the innocent!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_3,HAHAHA! As if I would need your permission.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_4,This marks the end for all of you inferior beings!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_INTRO_5,"Now make this fight worthwhile, Witch!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_MID_0,Your attempt to stop me is laughable. How pitiful can you get?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_0,That was the last major player on the list. What now?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_1,The final Death Seed was used and the fourth Horseman of Apocalypse has been chosen.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_2,"With their unfaltering cooperation, the age of humans is over."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_3,That sounds like it's time to get the popcorn on.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_4,Father...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_NEMESIS_09_END_5,The earth is prepared for your arrival. The time to strike is now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_0,Archangel is still down. Do you think he's okay?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_1,No. He was weak. Apocalypse was too much for him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_2,"He's waking up! Archangel, are you all right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_3,I am not Archangel.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_4,I am DEATH.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_5,We know who you are! And we're going to stop you right here and now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_01_INTRO_6,Wait!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_0,Hand him over before he joins the rest of Apocalypse's Horsemen!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_1,No! There is still hope! Warren is still in there. I can feel him!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_2,Apocalypse has only brainwashed him. We just need to break the hold.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_3,"Psylocke, the other Horsemen are on their way. Do you really want to stand in their way?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_4,"Surrender him now, or you will leave us with no choice."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_02_INTRO_5,Try and take me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_0,"So he still has some fight in him, eh? Maybe there IS a chance."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_1,I want to use the Death Seed on him.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_2,The Death Seed? Do you think it can bring Warren back?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_3,"It could. Or it could scramble his brains forever. Either way, I'm going to need some time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_4,There is no time in Death- just destiny.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_03_INTRO_5,And try to keep him quiet. I can only take so much of that nonsense.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_0,"You can't save him. Just like Morgan Le Fay, he is one of the THEM now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_1,No! Warren's psyche is responding. He's still in there!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_2,Just give us more time to try the Death Seed.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_3,The Death Seed? Are you mad? That will bring only chaos!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_4,The other Horsemen will be here soon. Stand aside!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_INTRO_5,We will not!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_END_0,"I think it's actually working. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_END_1,"Psylocke, what do you see?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_04_END_2,I see him! I think it IS working!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_0,Warren?! It's me! Can you hear me?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_1,"Am I… ""Death""??"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_2,"Yes, my child, you ARE Death."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_3,You are now the FOURTH Horsemen of Apocalypse!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_4,"C'mon now, sugah. Don't be shy! Your new family is here!!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_5,"Yeah, but I ain't huggin' anybody."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_INTRO_6,Stay away from him!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_0,Death! I am so proud of you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_1,Facing all three Horsemen? \n Well done.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_2,But the games are over.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_3,"And Dark Beast, you old fool. I have spent years mastering the secrets of the Death Seeds. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_4,Did you think your little science experiment could undo MY creation?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_5,"I am DEATH. And I am ready to serve, Apocalypse!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_DEATH_05_END_6,We have work to do.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_0,"Hey, is this thing on? S.T.R.I.K.E. Commander, are you reading me?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_1,"Oh, hey. Yeah, so... we might have a tiny problem. And by tiny, I mean huge, and by problem, I mean PROBLEM."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_2,"So, we were running this experiment right, and..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_3,Dad! Get to the point!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_4,"Oh, yeah, sorry. So have you ever heard of Kang? Tall guy, loves purple. Penchant for Conquering. Ringing any bells?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_5,"Well, we kinda... unleashed a whole bunch of Multiversal variants of him."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_6,"I asked around, and it sounds like dealing with that sort of thing is your job, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_7,"If you could do something about all these Kangs... this 'Kangtastrophe' if you will, that would be great."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_8,We'll send you all the info we have. Good luck! Thanks! So great to have you on the team...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_9,DAD!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KANG_01_START_10,"Yep! Info, we'll send it. Good luck and all that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_INTRO_0,"The final battle begins, my loyal servants. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_INTRO_1,"The humans and mutant betrayers seek to stop my ascension. But they are too late. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_INTRO_2,"I selected my Horsemen carefully. Soon, they shall see why. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_INTRO_3,"As I prepare for the end, Pestilence... Show these fools that they are no more than insects. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_INTRO_4,"As you will it, Lord Apocalypse."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_END_0,"Ha! Watch as they scatter, like ants! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_END_1,"You've done well, Pestilence. But it's time for your true purpose. Prepare the ritual..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_END_2,"Fulfill the promise you made when you freed me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_END_3,"Yes. A world, free of heroes, free of S.T.R.I.K.E..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_01_END_4,"One that we shall recreate here, on Nexus Earth!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_0,"Okay, Web-Warriors - and yes, that is our OFFICIAL NAME, no complaining - time for us to swing into action."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_1,"So, this Apocalypse? How worried should I be? He seems like a big-time Big Bad."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_2,He's about as big and bad as they get. But as long as... we... stick together...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_3,"Are you okay, Peter?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_4,I think so... Something feels off...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_5,It's not my Spidey-Sense... I feel... w-weakened...?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_INTRO_6,"That'd be me, Shug'. Y'all are about to waste away to nothin'. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_END_0,"Sent those Spiders runnin' home to Fury. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_END_1,"Tried to pull a few legs off in the process. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_END_2,"Excellent work. Prepare yourself for the next step... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_END_3,"You shall be the conduit through which my new world is born. It will require all your strength. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_02_END_4,"It'll be mah honor, Lord Apocalypse. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_INTRO_0,"Our enemies send their foot soldiers in waves. The next battle is upon us... I sense it in the air. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_INTRO_1,*THUNDER*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_INTRO_2,"Go, War. Show them not even gods may stand against what is to come.  "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_INTRO_3,Let their hammers break against my fists!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_INTRO_4,FOR APOCALYPSE! RAAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_0,Ha! Is this all Fury has to send against me? Against the EMBODIMENT of WAR?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_1,"I know the God of War, monster... You are no God of War. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_2,You will know defeat before the day is out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_3,You Asgardians couldn't get past the front door! Besides...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_4,"You want to stop us? You're gonna have to put us down for good. And you don't got the spine for that, boy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_5,Ha. Perhaps. But that may be why another was trusted to that task.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_6,"Is that so? Well, you tell them when they get here to come see me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_7,"No problem. I've fought too many Hulks to count. Yer small game. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_03_END_8,"I'm here for Apocalypse. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_0,"You think you're gonna get past me, pipsqueak? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_1,"Was plannin' on going through you, actually. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_2,"Bring it on, little man!!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_3,"Stand aside, War!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_4,"Our lord has sent me to deal with Wolverine and his allies specifically. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_5,"After all... Someone so willing to deal out death should have to face Death himself. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_INTRO_6,"Worthington... If yer in there... Then you know I ain't sorry about what I gotta do next. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_0,"Their assassins have fallen, my lord. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_1,"Death, my favorite Horseman... You have served me well. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_2,"Our enemies turn to ash before us, and soon this entire Earth will follow. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_3,"Famine shall absorb the limitless rage of War, channel it to Pestilence, and her spell will bring an entire world's army to me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_4,"And then, as it always should have been, I shall rule not one world but them all!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_04_END_5,"You know, that's what they all say. Right before I step in and really make a mess of things."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_0,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I interrupt your big speech? Please, continue."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_1,"Nick Fury... You have come to face your end. Admirable. For centuries, lesser men attempted to flee my wrath."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_2,It did not save them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_3,"Now, why would I run away? After all that time and energy drawing you out so I could hear your big plan?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_4,"Bringing another world to ours, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_INTRO_5,"Well, if you're so interested in the Multiverse, maybe it's time you met some of my favorite people in it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_END_0,"You try to stand against me? I am the thing of legend, ancient, and all-powerful!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_END_1,"You are but a footnote in history. I, Apocalypse, am history itself."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_END_2,"You know what, for once, we agree. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_END_3,Let's put you back in your tomb with the rest of the relics.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_05_END_4,S.T.R.I.K.E.? TAKE APOCALYPSE DOWN!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_06_INTRO_0,"Gambit, take the lead! I'm trying to cook up something to handle the Multiversal energy swirling around!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_06_INTRO_1,"Ain't no problem... Gambit loves the chance to showboat a li'l. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_06_INTRO_2,"Ah've seen you show off, Shug', and it never gets old. Shame ah gotta put an end to it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_06_INTRO_3,"Cher, if der's any piece of you left... Come back t' me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_06_INTRO_4,"Ah'm right here, Remy. Come closer... So ah can give you a kiss!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_0,"War approaches, my green friend. Handle him, and I will deal with Famine."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_1,SMASH!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_2,"You'll deal with me, Strange? I stopped your precious Scarlet Witch, I've unleashed Apocalypse..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_3,What makes you think you can prevent me from doing as I please?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_4,"I didn't sell my soul watching my universe collapse to have it happen again here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_07_INTRO_5,"By all that exists between realms, you will not complete that ritual!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_0,"Mystics are down, Hulk took a beating... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_1,Time to fall back?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_2,"Not yet. I've got one last play. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_3,"Apocalypse? Meet the Eternals. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_4,More false gods?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_5,"With my servants by my side and the ritual nearly finished, my powers are at their apex."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_INTRO_6,Come and see... And face the full fury of Apocalypse and his Horsemen!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_END_0,"All your idols have fallen. As the strongest among you, I have proven that this world is mine to rule!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_END_1,My lord... It is done... The portal has been opened!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_END_2,"And now you have brought my perfect soldiers to me. A world I've conquered, conquering this new one!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_END_3,"We shall cover the Earth, and no one shall stand in our way!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_08_END_4,"To me, my Army of Apocalypse! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E. has fled. Now, our great work of culling the weak from the Multiverse can begin. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_1,"All will bow before you, Lord Apocalypse."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_2,"Our army pours through the rift Pestilence tore in the Multiverse, no one can stand... Wait... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_3,"Something familiar emerges. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_4,"Across the Multiverse, I felt this ripple. Another Apocalypse, trying to take my place at its center."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_5,"I give you a choice - bow before me, and be spared. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_6,"A true Apocalypse bows to no one. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_INTRO_7,"So come, pretender. And face your destruction!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_END_0,"All too easy. It's a curious feeling, to crush your own bones beneath your heel. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_END_1,"But it will not be the last time. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_END_2,"No matter how many versions of myself emerge from the Multiverse, alone or at the side of S.T.R.I.K.E., I will triumph."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_END_3,"For I am the one true force of nature here, at the Nexus of realities. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_APOCALYPSE_09_END_4,"Now, let the Age of Apocalypse begin!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_0,Cosmo? What did you call us for?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_1,Da. New survivors from Incursion increase with each passing day. It is imperative we consider accommodations.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_2,We must clear additional space for their shelter and refuge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_3,"I can do that, but there's a lot of junk here. Did you bring enough moving boxes?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_4,*Sniff sniff* We are not alone. We will need to fight!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_INTRO_5,Hold on. Don't we get to get warmed up first?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_MID_0,I think I pulled a hammy. Who are these guys?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_MID_1,"Vermin that exploit times of hardship, taking advantage of vulnerable people."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_MID_2,Such actions must be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_0,"*Bzzt* Come in, Cosmo!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_1,"Cosmo, here. What do you need?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_2,We received an urgent distress call from an approaching ship.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_3,Go ahead with Korg. I'll clean up the mess here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_4,"Thank you, comrade."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_01_END_5,Relay message to emergency pod. Cosmo will be piloting over to offer our assistance.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_0,*Bzzt* Ready when you are.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_1,Connect us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_2,"Someone's aboard the ship! All-Fathers, give me strength."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_3,Cosmo is almost docked. Are you in secure location?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_4,We've been able to defend the bridge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_INTRO_5,"Having faith, comrade. Cosmo will find you, and we shall overcome this obstacle together."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_START_0,Relax everyone. It's just a dog.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_START_1,"GRRR! Cosmo is NOT ""just a dog""!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_END_0,"Hostiles are dealt with, comrade."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_END_1,Thank you for rescuing us. We're in your debt.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_END_2,"Aw, look at us all bonding and making friends."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_02_END_3,Da. Cosmo will share delicious treats once we arrive at Knowhere.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_0,"Good job, Cosmo, but we have a problem. I'll play the transmission."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_1,"Is this thing on? Hello, Knowhere! You're probably wondering why I've stepped away from my experiments to chat with you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_2,"Imagine my surprise, if you can, when I scanned that ship and noticed a blank spot in the data."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_3,"Naturally, I want to study whatever is causing it, but you see how you have us in a pickle, don't you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_4,I'll do whatever it takes to get that ship. We can even be friends!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_5,I've gone on long enough... Long enough for you to miss the sound of my team sneaking into Knowhere!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_INTRO_6,Initiate the surprise attack!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_START_0,Target spotted!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_START_1,Cosmo will not allow stealing of refugees.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_START_2,"Yeah! Initiating the ""Stone Wall Strategy""!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_0,"Cosmo, we're receiving another call from the attackers."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_1,Connect us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_2,What do you want?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_3,"Okay, so, MAYBE I didn't get our friendship off on the right foot with that sneak attack."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_4,And I'm not too proud to admit that maybe I wasn't as generous with your survival chance as I could have been.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_03_END_5,But the next group that infiltrated Knowhere? Real pros.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_INTRO_0,"*Bzzt* Come in, Cosmo! Say the word, and I'll regroup with you and Korg."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_INTRO_1,I can't wait to wreck these guys.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_INTRO_2,This is not final assault.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_INTRO_3,Please assist refugees to reinforce Knowhere's defenses.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_INTRO_4,Cosmo tends to intruders.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_START_0,You will not be proceeding further.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_START_1,I'll make a scorch mark out of ya!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_END_0,"Come in, Knowhere. I've hacked into your systems and I KNOW WHERE you're all hiding."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_END_2,Nothing?? Really? That joke had a 93.76% chance of drawing a laugh.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_04_END_3,Never mind. This next one is going to KILL.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_0,Nyet. It matters not what you try. Cosmo will stop you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_1,"In that case, I hope you won't mind if I use you to test out a li'l side project of mine."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_2,These baddies were homegrown in my lab with all the TLC - and genetic enhancements - they could handle.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_3,"Say ""hello,"" precious."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_4,SKRREEEEE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_INTRO_5,"I'm pretty sure that translates to ""hello""."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_MID_0,What's going on here?! Quit being such an anomaly!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_END_0,These chew toys are much appreciated. Very fun.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_END_1,A simple miscalculation. Imaginary numbers can be tricky.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_END_2,"Scientists should be good at math, da?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_END_3,A dog is taunting me?! Seriously?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_05_END_4,That's it. Send EVERYONE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_INTRO_0,End of the line.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_INTRO_1,You're all out of escape routes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_INTRO_2,It's no use! We're trapped!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_INTRO_3,"Cosmo, what do we do?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_INTRO_4,Cosmo will protect you while you escape.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_MID_0,"Bozhe moi, there is no end to them! Stand with Cosmo and fight, comrades! Stand and defend Knowhere!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_MID_1,Looks like you could use a hand.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_0,"Your help is much appreciated, comrade Heimdall."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_1,We can't handle them alone. We're too thinly spread.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_2,Da. Cosmo agrees.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_3,Knowhere will be needing to signal for help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_4,I'll take care of these people. You get that signal out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_06_END_5,Cosmo will move quickly.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_0,Hmm... Control room is under enemy occupation.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_1,Cosmo has trick for this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_2,BARK! BARK!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_3,What's a cute puppy doing on this dingy station? And it's dressed up as an astronaut. Adorable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_4,That's hardly a puppy.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_INTRO_5,GRRRR... Cosmo is cute and adorable no matter age!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_MID_0,"Irritating enemies, but Cosmo is close to the transmitter."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_END_0,Knowhere is under attack by mad scientist and requires assistance!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_END_1,Signal is out in universe now.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_07_END_2,Cosmo will be having faith that help arrives soon.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_0,No! Bad girl! No barking for help. You'll wake the neighbors!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_1,Pah! Cosmo will chase you away.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_2,You're hardly an efficient guard dog. Knowhere's door was wide open just waiting for me to board.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_3,"I AM going to get my hands on that crew and their ship. I'll trade you a tennis ball for them. Enticing, isn't it?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_4,Nyet. Cosmo has placed telekinetic barriers at exit of Control Room. You are trapped with Cosmo.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_INTRO_5,"That's powerful telekinesis. It's your lucky day, Spot. You're coming with me so I can figure out what you really are."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_MID_0,"Bzzt... Cosmo, come in. I've brought help, but we're caught in a skirmish."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_MID_1,Comrade Nova! A voice for sore ears. Cosmo leads enemy to you for to regroup.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_END_0,This is impossible odds. Cosmo is out of here!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_END_1,One of the barriers is down! Don't let that mutt escape!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_END_2,Wait... Who is that at the end of the hall?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_08_END_3,Oh no...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_INTRO_0,The fun has arrived.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_INTRO_1,Comrade Nova? There is something different about you.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_INTRO_2,Nevermind that. Let's help this scientist find her way back to her lab.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_INTRO_3,This would please Cosmo.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_MID_0,This is what I get for not factoring in Murphy's Law.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_MID_1,RETREAT!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_0,Why were they after that crew?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_1,That would be due to my little visit to Asgard.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_2,GRRR... Who are you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_3,"Easy there, dog. I was simply on my way to notify the Commander of my findings when the ship was scanned."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_4,Are we to be believing trickster god?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_5,"You know, everyone's distrust of me is getting rather dull."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_COSMO_09_END_6,Perhaps it's best if I show you...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_INTRO_0,"Kamala Khan, you're in danger."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_INTRO_1,Nick Fury?! The REAL Nick Fury?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_INTRO_2,Did you hear a word I just said?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_INTRO_3,Yes! Okay. So I'm in danger?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_INTRO_4,Kree forces are heading to your location now. Get ready.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_START_0,Kamala. The Supreme Intelligence requires you. Come with us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_START_1,The who? Aren't you the bad guys? I'm not going with you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_START_2,I thought you might say that.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_START_3,Ms. Marvel (Hard Light)'s <color=#fff568>Special Ability</color> can copy and clear positive effects from targets while removing negative effects from her allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_01_START_4,Her <color=#fff568>Ultimate Ability</color> can flip Taunt to Defense Down on all enemies while adding Defense Up to herself.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_INTRO_0,"The Supreme Intelligence is an AI that rules the Kree. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_INTRO_1,"Whatever it wants from you, it can't be good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_INTRO_2,"Fury, a Kree force is now closing in on Monica Rambeau's location."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_INTRO_3,This is no coincidence. You both have light energy powers. The Kree are up to something.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_INTRO_4,"We need to warn her! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_END_0,Where's Photon?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_END_1,Don't worry. We just needed to borrow her since you were unavailable.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_02_END_2,You can have her when the Supreme Intelligence has completed its mission.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_03_INTRO_0,We've tracked Photon's location to one of Dark Beast's secret labs.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_03_INTRO_1,"""Dark Beast""? What is that?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_03_INTRO_2,A psychopath in a lab coat. It's not a good thing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_03_INTRO_3,Let's go!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_INTRO_0,Hand over Monica!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_INTRO_1,But I haven't even started the examination yet. Please come back later and you can have what's left of her.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_INTRO_2,"There will be no ""examination""!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_0,Whew! Thanks! I don't know how much more of that stench I could handle.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_1,"Start talking, McCoy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_2,"Of course. I have no allegiance to the Kree or their ""leader""."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_3,"I'll give it to you straight. Their Supremor is trying to access the Light Dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_4,"Something about ""gaining an unprecedented advantage in their intergalactic conquests""."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_04_END_5,I'm just helping them out in exchange for access to their subjects. They might already have Danvers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_INTRO_0,"Kamala, the Kree... *radio static*... help! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_INTRO_1,Nick Fury! Captain Marvel just sent me a transmission. I think she needs my help!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_INTRO_2,She needs YOUR help?! Are you sure about that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_INTRO_3,No. But I'm going to find out. The transmission came from Colorado.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_INTRO_4,Be careful.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_END_0,She's not here. But the Kree were. Maybe we were too late.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_05_END_1,"Fury, we've just spotted a Kree Warship in orbit right above us... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_INTRO_0,"I'm going to that warship. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_INTRO_1,You want to take on a Kree Warship?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_INTRO_2,I'm going with her.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_INTRO_3,"If Captain Marvel needs my help, I can't ignore it."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_END_0,Where's Captain Marvel?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_06_END_1,Don't hurt me! She's in the lab downstairs!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_07_INTRO_0,So you finally changed your mind?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_07_INTRO_1,Just step into the chamber right here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_07_INTRO_2,I'm not here to volunteer! I'm here to find my friend!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_INTRO_0,There she is!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_INTRO_1,"I'll get you out of there, Captain Marvel!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_INTRO_2,No you will not.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_END_0,Carol?! Can you hear me?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_END_1,"Yes. Kamala. Now help the Kree open the portal to the Light Dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_08_END_2,What?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_0,You want me to HELP them?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_1,Yes. Just step over to the portal. I've already done my part.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_2,Um... Well... Ok...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_3,*FLASH!!*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_4,Stop!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_5,"Captain Marvel?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_6,Sorry I'm late. That's the Kree Supreme Intelligence you're talking to. It can take on any form in your mind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_7,"And it cannot be trusted with access to the Light Dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_8,Then let's get out of here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_INTRO_9,Just after we destroy this portal.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_END_0,"That was close. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_END_1,We should keep better tabs on each other. There could be others who want our powers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_END_2,"Are you adding me as a friend?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_KAMALA_09_END_3,Sure.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_0,ON THE REMNANTS OF A WORLD DESTROYED DURING AN INCURSION...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_1,Stay away from me!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_2,I've come to deliver you from this wasteland and welcome you to my glorious undead army.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_3,"Lady, I survived the world endin'. You think you're gonna take me down?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_4,Me? <b>I</b> don't have to do a thing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_5,Food...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_6,Get away from me! AAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_7,Need... BRAINS!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_INTRO_8,"Welcome to the team. Now, let's get you a suitable meal."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_START_0,Juggernaut! 'Bout time you got back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_START_1,*SNIFF* That ain't him. Not anymore. Somebody better start talkin'.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_START_2,BRAINNSS!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_END_0,"Yes, I think you'll do quite nicely - a hidden gem, as it were."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_END_1,So... Hungry...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_01_END_2,"Oh, fine. Another snack, then? Some will say I'm spoiling you rotten."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_INTRO_0,Hela. You've overstepped your bounds.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_INTRO_1,Doom has plans for this dimension. Your trail of destruction will impede them no longer.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_INTRO_2,Those monstrosities are coming with me.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_INTRO_3,You speak as though you already won.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_INTRO_4,None can withstand the might of Doom.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_MID_0,"Struggle all you like. If I cannot take them, I'll trap you all here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_END_0,He thought he could stand against the goddess of death?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_END_1,The arrogance of humans with even a sliver of power is staggering.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_END_2,F... ollow...?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_02_END_3,No. Let this sad king rule over nothing. We'll return to the Nexus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_0,Doom's drones... searching...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_1,Then we must find a place where they can't follow our escape.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_2,There...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_3,That location is sufficient.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_4,Make haste before...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_INTRO_5,Subjects located!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_MID_0,Too late.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_MID_1,More... drones... coming
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_0,Enough of this! Our window of success shrinks with every passing moment!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_1,We are free of that desolate rock.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_2,And Doom is none the wiser.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_3,Where... now?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_4,Somewhere we can really let loose and play.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_5,PLANETSIDE...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_6,B-Buh...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_JUGZ_03_END_7,BRAINNSS!!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_0,(Rykers Island - New York State Prison)
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_1,"Hey, ""Craving""! You got a visitor. A real ugly one."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_2,"It's ""Kraven"". And when I get out of here, you will be my first prey."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_3,"Yeah, whatever. Loser."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_4,"I have a proposition for you. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_5,I'm listening.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_6,I need your help hunting someone. A very special someone.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_7,I like this. But how?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_8,<CLACK!>
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_INTRO_9,I've just unlocked all the prison doors. Meet me at the docks when you're done with these guards.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_START_0,Kraven the Hunter is a vicious brawler for the Superior Six who applies Offense Down and other negative effects for all his attacks.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_START_1,"His Special ability will chain to multiple targets, applying Offense Down and flipping positive effects on each target."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_START_2,"For his Ultimate ability, he attacks all enemies, applying Offense Down, Slow, and flips Deathproof and Stealth for each target."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_01_START_3,"When battling in Cosmic Crucible, he imposes additional damage and negative effects upon his enemies."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_0,I'm working on a project that will help us hunt down Spider-Man.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_1,I don't need any help hunting down my prey.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_2,Of course. But this won't help you just hunt Spider-Man...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_3,This will help you hunt down ALL the Spiders.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_4,What are you talking about?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_5,"Ugh. We have visitors. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_INTRO_6,Your friends from the Rykers Island must have followed you here.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_END_0,I'm building a portal that is specifically designed to find every Spider-Man in existence throughout the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_END_1,"But I need your help first. The portal needs to be tuned with Spider-Man's DNA. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_END_2,Hunt down our own Spider-Man here in New York and get a sample.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_END_3,How about some of his blood?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_02_END_4,That will work.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_INTRO_0,Where's Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_INTRO_1,Probably somewhere putting away more bad guys like you. Why?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_INTRO_2,I need his blood... and to repay him for getting me locked up.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_INTRO_3,"You're ""The Hunter"". Go find him yourself."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_INTRO_4,Perhaps YOUR blood will get his attention.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_END_0,Ok! Ok! I will help you! As long as you don't hurt Spider-Man!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_END_1,I'll consider it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_END_2,"S.H.I.E.L.D. has vials of his blood. They are being transported on a Helicarrier launching from the Upper Bay. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_END_3,"It's heavily defended, but you might get to it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_03_END_4,I'll get to it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_0,(Helicarrier Flight Deck- Upper Bay)
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_1,"Fury, we've got some prisoners on the loose after that Ryker's Island sabotage event. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_2,I've heard. Anybody we should worried about?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_3,"There's one kook. He wears fur around his neck and considers himself a big game hunter. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_4,Where do these people come from?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_5,Russia.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_6,"I am Kraven the Hunter. And if you stand in my way, you will go down like all of my prey before you."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_INTRO_7,Somebody please escort this man off my Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_START_0,Hand over Spider-Man's blood sample. I know you have it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_04_START_1,"I'm not handing anything over to you. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_05_INTRO_0,Mockingbird! Kraven is heading your way. He's going for the lab samples!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_05_INTRO_1,On it!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_05_INTRO_2,"I don't normally take down little birds, but today I will make an exception."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_INTRO_0,"I have the blood sample. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_INTRO_1,"Splendid. I will need some time to prepare the Spider Serum. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_INTRO_2,"Do not let any intruders in. If I am interrupted, it could spoil the whole batch."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_INTRO_3,Nobody will get by me.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_END_0,"Well done. The Spider Serum is ready. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_END_1,How do you know it will work?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_06_END_2,"My calculations have all been tested already. If something goes wrong, it is the blood sample."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_0,Everything is set.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_1,"3...2...1... "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_2,<Bzztt ka-chonk!>
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_3,"What?! "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_4,Is it supposed to be smoking like that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_5,That blood was a fake! Did you get it from Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_6,I pulled it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility. The Ghost Spider lied! She set me up!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_7,You fool! Where are we going to get fresh Spider-Man blood from now?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_8,Looking for me?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_9,Spider-Man!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_10,That's right. No more people will get hurt from your little science project.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_07_INTRO_11,"Say goodbye to your machine, Osborn."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_08_INTRO_0,"Ah, finally! Spider-Man DNA. Pure and fresh. "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_08_INTRO_1,Stand back while I form the true Spider-Serum.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_08_INTRO_2,More of his friends are approaching. I'll take care of them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_08_END_0,"That's it! We have it! "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_KRAVEN_08_END_1,Let the hunt begin.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_0,"This has been fun, Norman, but you've hinted at something greater for gathering us together."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_1,"Indeed. What's your end-game, Osborn?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_2,"My plan is simple. I've gathered we ""Superior Six"" for the sole purpose of defeating the scourge of spiders once and for all."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_3,Within this city are ten unique spider heroes from across space and time.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_4,"Their genetic profiles are the key to understanding the very creation of the ""Spider Verse"" and its idiot inhabitants!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_INTRO_5,"By capturing them and mapping their genetics, we can unlock the ability to be rid of these spider heroes once and for all!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_START_0,What the heck? Who are you?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_START_1,"Fool, you face the might of the Superior Six!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_START_2,Six? I only count five of you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_START_3,Silence!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_END_0,What is that what are you doing?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_END_1,"Don't be afraid, little spider. You're just one piece of a far greater puzzle..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_01_END_2,"And soon, when that puzzle is completed your kind will be nothing more than a footnote in the history of my triumph!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_INTRO_0,"How exactly does the genetics of a bunch of spider heroes allow us to ""be rid of them""?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_INTRO_1,"Patience, Otto. You'll see the greatness of my plan in the fullness of time!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_START_0,Is it Halloween already?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_START_1,We'll see if you're so glib when you're trapped in MY web!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_START_2,You have webs now?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_02_END_0,"Restrain him, Kraven. Lizard, get the sample."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_INTRO_0,"What progress, Lizard?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_INTRO_1,Promissssing! Your theory isss valid!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_INTRO_2,Muhahahahaha! Excellent!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_START_0,Spider sense... woah!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_END_0,Extracting sssample...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_END_1,"Facing children is no test of my skill, Goblin. When do I get a real challenge?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_03_END_2,"Soon, Kraven, soon!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_INTRO_0,"One of the spiders is close, but this one has an odd... scent. Like rain."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_START_0,You fellas look lost. And dastardly.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_START_1,"Hot off the presses, black and white Spider Man is about to be black and blue!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_START_2,I reject that headline!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_END_0,"Curious, even in our dimension this one somehow remains monochromatic."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_END_1,What quirk of science can possibly explain that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_04_END_2,"Write a paper on it later, Octavius. We have mayhem to do!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_INTRO_0,"Goblin, I think it's time you let the rest of us in on how this plan of yours works."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_INTRO_1,"Ahahahaha! It's so SIMPLE. First, we fully map the genetics of the ten spiders."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_INTRO_2,NEXT we create the ultimate BUG BOMB!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_INTRO_3,It will seek out and destroy EVERY SPIDER! Then we unleash it!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_START_0,I don't have time for you chumps today.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_05_END_0,"Five ssspiders down, five ssspiders to go!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_0,"So this ""bug bomb"", how does it work?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_1,"The fine details are too much for anyone but I to grasp, Octavius."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_2,"But suffice to say it will rid us of not just the Spider-People of our world, but all the ones imported by that alien warlord too!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_3,Your explanation seems overly simplistic.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_4,Silence! Who else has the brilliance required?! Who else has the MASTERY of genetics and technology?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_INTRO_5,"I DO, and that is why my plan CANNOT FAIL! MUHAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_START_0,All five of you together? That can't be good.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_END_0,"Lizard, you're a geneticist. Certainly you find Goblin's plan lacking in... fine details, do you not?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_END_1,What we ssstole from the mutantsss wasss the key. Thisss plan can work.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_06_END_2,The mutants are what concern me. The one called Apocalypse I've heard of. We should not have bested him so easily.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_INTRO_0,"Your concerns are warranted, Doctor. We defeated that mutant far too easily."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_INTRO_1,We need to find out more about who he was. Perhaps he had some ulterior motive for allowing us to steal his research?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_INTRO_2,I'll see what dirt I can dig up on him.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_0,"[I won't let you do this, Goblin!]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_1,"[Shut Up, Norman! You were too WEAK to do what needs to be done! But I'm not.]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_2,"[This plan is madness, even for you. Something's not right!]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_3,"[ENOUGH! Back in your box, Osborn!]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_4,[No! If I can just... connect my mind to the mainframe...]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_07_END_5,[Naughty Norman! I said BACK IN YOUR BOX!]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_0,Apocalypse is some kind of ancient mutant. What I've learned is that he is a master of manipulation and mind control!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_1,Do you think he is manipulating Goblin?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_2,"To what end? As far as we know Spider Man and his ilk aren't mutants, but genetic aberrations of science."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_3,"Apocalypse once attempted to develop a virus that killed all non-mutants. Maybe the ""bug bomb"" is something similar?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_4,"Lizard, we are in need of your expertise."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_INTRO_5,I will analysssse. Give me the data...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_START_0,"YES! YES! We are nearly ready! Step into my parlor, said the Goblin to the Spider!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_START_1,"You're deranged, Goblin. Your reign of terror ends now!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_START_2,"AH, HAHAHAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_0,"It isss asss thought. The ""bug bomb"" is basssed on the anti-human virusss. It will not do what Goblin thinksss."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_1,"What WILl it do, once unleashed?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_2,Unclear. It rewrites geneticsss and isss very cleverly disguisssed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_3,"Goblin must be under Apocalypse's control somehow. Lizard, if we subdue him can you purge the mutant's control?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_4,Possibly? Testsss must be run. Samplesss taken. Osborn'sss condition isss complex.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_08_END_5,"So, we know what we must do."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_INTRO_0,"Goblin, we have a problem."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_INTRO_1,WHAT PROBLEM?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_INTRO_2,Your plan will fail. You're being manipulated by that mutant we stole the research from--the one called Apocalypse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_INTRO_3,Stand down and let Lizard analyze you so we can break the mutant's hold on your mind.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_INTRO_4,WHAT TREACHERY IS THIS? I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL FOR THIS!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_START_0,I don't need you traitorous minions anymore! I can complete the weapon myself!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_START_1,Restrain him!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_0,Uh... no... what... what am I doing?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_1,"[DO NOT RESIST, HUMAN. DO AS I HAVE COMMANDED!]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_2,"No No No No NO! No More Osborn, no more! I AM IN CONTROL!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_3,I believe we are seeing Goblin's personalities vie for control. Perhaps Apocalypse is only able to manipulate the Goblin persona?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_4,How does that help us right now?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_MID_5,"It doesn't, take him down!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_0,I have found the key... foreign machinesss in his blood.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_1,"The anti-human virus was partly nanotechnological in nature. Your theory was right, Octavius. Can we purge it?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_2,This technology is beyond even I...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_3,But... not...ME!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_4,AHHHHHRRRRGGGHHHH!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_5,[CEASE YOUR RESISTANCE. OBEY!]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_6,You will... NEVER control... NORMAN OSBORN!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_7,ARGGGHHH UGHHH UH.....
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_09_END_8,The Goblin suit is... countering the nanomachines somehow.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_0,"Is it you, Osborn? Are you back?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_1,Yes... barely. I'm free of that insufferable mutant in my mind.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_2,"Even as he controlled my actions as GreenGoblin, he couldn't override the mental link I have with my OsCorp tech."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_3,I willed my companion AI to access all OsCorp's nanotech and genetics research to find a cure. And once you stopped me I found a moment to act.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_4,What was the mutant's goal? Why gather us and why target spider heroes?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_INTRO_5,"I don't know. But what I DO know is, it's time for some good old fashioned PAYBACK!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_START_0,"Sugar, the boss man don't want no visitors right now. Why don't y'all skedaddle before one of you gets hurt?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_0,APOCALYPSE!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_1,Where are you hiding? I've come for revenge!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_2,FOOLISH HUMAN. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TRULY FACE THE MIGHT OF APOCALYPSE?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_3,"We took down your lackys, you're next!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_4,INSOLENT WORM. I AM AS FAR BEYOND THEM AS THEY ARE BEYOND YOU.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_5,"I HAVE LIVED THROUGH EPOCHS AND AGES, THROUGH TERROR AND TIMULT."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_6,YOU COULD HAVE BEEN THE INSTRUMENT OF GLORIOUS CHANGE AND PROGRESS.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_MID_7,"INSTEAD, YOU WILL BE A LESSON TO THOSE THAT FAIL TO SERVE THEIR SUPERIORS."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_0,"LITTLE HUMANS, THIS DEFEAT CHANGES NOTHING. YOU HAVE MERELY WON A BATTLE IN A WAR YOU CANNOT COMPREHEND."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_1,SAVOR YOUR FLEETING VICTORY BUT KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT FIT TO CHALLENGE APOCALYPSE.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_2,What just happened?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_3,Some kind of teleportation tech. If he really is as old as he claims it makes sense he'd have contingencies.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_4,Let's blow this place up just to be spiteful. And after that...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_S6EE_10_END_5,Gentlemen I think we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_INTRO_0,"NEW YORK CITY, A DISTANT UNIVERSE..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_INTRO_1,"Nowhere to hide, you masked menace!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_INTRO_2,"Anywhere you can go, I can go too!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_INTRO_3,Aren't you a journalist? Where did you even get... Whatever that is?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_INTRO_4,A good reporter keeps his sources close. Now stop moving so I can pop you like the pimple you are!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_MID_0,Kraven? Never thought I'd be glad to see him.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_MID_1,"Talk about a lucky break! I'm getting out of here before you can say ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" See ya, lovebirds!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_MID_2,You! Where is Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_MID_3,"You just let him escape, fur for brains! I had him right where I wanted him!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_END_0,You expect me to believe an oversized tin can stood a chance against my most elusive prey?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_END_1,This baby is upgraded up the wazoo!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_END_2,"If he manages to alert his friends, it won't matter what upgrades you have. We have a common enemy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_END_3,HA! That freak has no friends.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_01_END_4,But I see where you're going with this.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_START_0,"I bet you thought you got away clean, didn't you?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_START_1,"If anyone is going to land the final blow, it will be me."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_START_2,"Let's call it a day, guys. I have better stuff to do."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_0,I can read the headline now: Handsome and powerful Chief of the Daily Bugle puts an end to the wall crawler's reign of terror!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_1,"Not such a smart aleck anymore, eh Web-Head?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_2,"Why the long face, Kraven? We finally took him down."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_3,"I was promised all manner of Spiders, and still I get this... boy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_4,You're telling me there are more of these things crawling around out there?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_5,Many versions infest the Multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_02_END_6,Enough talk. How do we track these troublemakers down? Give me answers and give 'em fast!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_0,"You've been using portal technology, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_1,The Spider-Man DNA in this machine makes my tracking state-of-the-art.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_2,Is that why we've only been able to hunt Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_3,Perhaps we can properly tune the machine using the robot.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_4,"Look, pal, I'm tellin' you now: you break it, you're payin' for it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_5,This won't hurt a bit.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_6,HEY!\nLook at that. I got the details on different Spiders.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_INTRO_7,One of their threads could connect this portal to every Spider in existence.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_START_0,"Hold the front page! Spider-Slayer's on the scene to handle your pesky bug problem. No need to panic, just leave it to the professionals."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_START_1,You've got to be kidding...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_START_2,You're cornered.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_START_3,Hagoshii. Let's do this!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_0,Spider-Weaver! There's been a significant reading of power destabilizing the Web. You're needed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_1,"I'd love to stay and play, but there's work to do."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_2,NO!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_3,"Calm down, Kraven, you animal! We got what we needed."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_4,This is truly a remarkable component.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_5,Enough mumbling! Is the portal working or not?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_6,I'm connecting to their Web of Life and Destiny. This requires finesse. Something you'd know nothing about.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_03_END_7,It's like fish in a barrel.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_START_0,The portal is finally useful!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_START_1,"Whoa, you're retro. You sure you belong here, gramps?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_START_2,Listen up people! You've got a new hero looking out for you!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_START_3,Someone that's going to rid this universe of its web-headed menace!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_START_4,"Okay, got it. You're nuts."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_0,You've let this hunt go to your head.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_1,"Don't let going obsolete get to you, Kraven. I'm sure there's a big sewer gator somewhere you can hunt."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_2,Obsolete?! You should be grateful I've let you indulge yourself with this toy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_3,Enough! Where is the next target?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_4,On tour.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_04_END_5,"Oi! We're gearing up to stick it to the fascist, capitalistic fatcats of the world with a proper sonic punk assault!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_05_START_0,"Taking the stage, it's SPIDER-SLAYER!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_05_START_1,"Didn't I bloody warn ya that they were programming us with the telly? Time to smash the screen, innit?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_05_END_0,"I'm telling you, something's not right! Hobie had a gig tonight."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_05_END_1,It's way too dead here in that case.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_05_END_2,"Well, well, maybe you wall-crawlers aren't as dimwitted as you appear."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_INTRO_0,You? You're the one attacking our friends?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_INTRO_1,I'm doing the Multiverse a favor in taking out you freaks.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_INTRO_2,We're drawing the line here. You're not hurting anyone else.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_INTRO_3,You brats don't know what you're up against.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_0,Crushing these spiders has been a piece of cake! This really highlights the incompetence of you so-called villains.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_1,How did you all have so much trouble with some itsy bitsy Spiders?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_2,"You grow too comfortable behind that screen, Jameson."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_3,Even you managed to let one escape.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_4,"That's defamation, Kraven!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_5,Am I misremembering the Weaver's escape?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_06_END_6,I was just making sure you're up to par to join me in nabbing her.\n\nCongrats. You passed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_INTRO_0,She's... in the sky?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_INTRO_1,The Weaver has fled to a Helicarrier. That could make this challenging.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_INTRO_2,"Don't get cold feet on me now, Kraven! Let's go!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_START_0,This helicarrier is a ghost town. Did you portal us to the wrong spot?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_START_1,No. You're exactly where we want you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_START_2,I'm never going to hear the end of this.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_END_0,We need to regroup. The Goblin should have an idea for dealing with these annoyances.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_END_1,Err... One problem. Something's mucking with this blasted portal!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_07_END_2,We need to find a clear signal to portal out of here.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_INTRO_0,Great. What part of the ship are we in now?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_INTRO_1,Do I look like an engineer to you?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_INTRO_2,"Trust me, Kraven. You don't want me to tell you what you look like."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_INTRO_3,I think you both look ridiculous. But I still can't let you leave with that tracking tech.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_INTRO_4,What a world it is when your prey comes to you.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_0,Kestrel! NOW!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_1,"Get away from me, you buzzard!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_2,You two play nice in these cells while we figure out if you were the source of the Web of Life and Destiny's disruption.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_3,I'm right back where I started!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_4,Quiet! I've got an idea.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_5,Ideas do not open cell doors.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_6,"Maybe not, but the robot is locked up, not me."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_7,I'll find the Goblin and get us back on track to knock Spider-Weaver off her high horse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_SPIDERSLAYER_08_END_8,*OPERATOR OFFLINE*
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_INTRO_0,"Lizard, I've come to recruit you. I'm in need of your... unique skills."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_INTRO_1,"And why ssshould I help you, Goblin?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_INTRO_2,My plan revolves around finally ridding the world of Spider-Man and his arachnid allies!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_INTRO_3,I'm lissstening....
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_START_0,"This is Lizard. Once a brilliant geneticist named Curt Connors, he transformed into the villainous Lizard in an experiment gone wrong."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_START_1,"As part of the Superior Six team, he excels in Cosmic Crucible."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_START_2,He is a Protector that consistently clears negative effects from Superior and Sinister Six allies.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_START_3,Lizard is also very fast and can gain Taunt from both his Special and Ultimate abilities.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_01_END_0,"I'll join you, Goblin. For now..."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_INTRO_0,Ssso what's the plan?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_INTRO_1,We are going to steal some of the most cutting edge genetics research from some of the most advanced geneticists alive...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_INTRO_2,Mutants!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_START_0,I don't remember seeing your enrollment forms.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_START_1,We're the onesss who've come to do the ssschooling!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_02_END_0,"Yes, yes! Quickly, search their database! We're looking for two mutants: One called Sinister and another called Apocalypse."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_INTRO_0,Excellent work. Sinister and Apocalypse are two of the greatest geneticists on the planet. With their research on mutations and genetics...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_INTRO_1,"and our brains, Lizard, we shall create a solution to the spider problem once and for all!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_INTRO_2,The one called Sssininster is based in... Antarctica?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_START_0,"I don't like the cold, Goblin!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_END_0,Isss that... a jungle over the cliff?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_END_1,"It's called the ""Savage Land"", I believe. I've heard of it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_03_END_2,The coordinatesss for Sinister'sss lab we stole from the X-Men is deep within that land.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_INTRO_0,From freezing cold so ssswealtering jungle... this is a ssstrange land.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_INTRO_1,No time for sightseeing! Find the mutant's lab!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_INTRO_2,"Perimeter alarms were right, looks like we've got unwelcome guests."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_MID_0,Ssso many... they must be clonessss!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_MID_1,But why of only these two?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_END_0,"Goblin, are you sure thisss mutant is what you sssay?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_04_END_1,"Trust your eyes, Lizard! His cloning skills are obviously far superior, imagine what else we'll find once we're inside."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_START_0,It would seem the security team outside failed. Who are you and what do you want here?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_START_1,We want.. IT ALL! BWAHAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_0,Who dares?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_1,I know who you are... Norman Osborn and Curt Connors. Why are you breaking into my laboratory?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_2,"We need your research, Sssinister! To destroy Spider-Man, ALL Spidersss infesting the world, forever!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_3,"Fascinating. I'll make you a deal, defeat my latest creation and I'll give you all my research complete with my notes."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_4,Oh this will be FUN!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_MID_5,"Computer, release clone Sigma twenty seven!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_END_0,"Incredible. Alas, it seems I have much work to do with that particular experiment."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_END_1,Luckily that alien invader left us with plenty of suitable test subjects.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_END_2,Give usss what was promised!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_05_END_3,"Yes, yes. A deal is a deal. I'm eager to see what your results are, Doctor."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_0,"Now for the next target. This mutant calls himself ""Apocalypse""."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_1,What did we learn about him from the files we stole from the X-Men?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_2,The data on him wasss encrypted. We haven't been able to break it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_3,WHAT?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_4,"I'm a doctor, Osssborn. Not a hacker!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_INTRO_5,Very well... I know who can break any encryption...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_START_0,I'm going to break into their systems and use S.H.I.E.L.D.'s cryptography programs to decrypt the files.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_START_1,"While I'm doing that, see if you can find those two idiots that got themselves captured. We'll need them later."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_START_2,"It's nice when the bad guys come to you, makes capturing them so much easier."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE2_0,"Security, repel the invaders!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE2_1,Osssborn!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE3_0,"Okay boys, that's enough of that. Stand down!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE3_1,Newsflash! Superior Six free Spider Slayer from Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE4_0,Awww nobody invited me to the party?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE4_1,"About time, get me out of here!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE4_2,OSSBORN?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_WAVE4_3,Almost done!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_END_0,"Files decrypted! Lizard, did you break out the others?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_END_1,Yesss.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_06_END_2,Time to go!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_INTRO_0,"Ssso tell me all that wasss worth it, Goblin."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_INTRO_1,BWAHAHAHA! OF COURSE!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_INTRO_2,We got everything. Apocalypse's lab is in Japan. Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_START_0,Is thisss the place?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_START_1,HOW AMUSING. HAVE YOU COME TO DIE?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_START_2,This is the place.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_0,That was... a little too easy.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_1,"What do you think, Norman?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_2,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_3,Norman?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_4,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_5,GOBLIN?!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_6,...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_07_END_7,"The lab's below, let's go."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_INTRO_0,"Osssborn, you are acting strangely."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_INTRO_1,[TELL THEM NOTHING. YOU SERVE ME NOW.]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_INTRO_2,"It's nothing, Lizard. Destroy the remaining defenders and find the research data we need."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_0,Odd... the computersss are unlocked and all research is unencrypted.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_1,It isss... very complicated. This mutant knows far more about genetics than imagined.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_2,"Don't look a gift goblin in the mouth, Lizard. Copy it all!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_3,"SOON, BWAHAHAHA! SOON SPIDER-MAN, AND ALL SPIDER-HEROES, WILL BE DESTROYED!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_4,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_LIZARD_08_END_5,"As you sssay, Osssborn..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_0,Sabretooth? What are you doing here?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_1,"Surrender, and we'll make this quick."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_2,"Nein, have you forgotten I can be anywhere?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_3,... !
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_4,What have you done?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_INTRO_5,You're not going anywhere until we get what we came for.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_START_0,"This is Kurt Wagner, aka Nightcrawler. His mutant power allows him to teleport anywhere he can see."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_START_1,As an integral member of the X-treme X-men he is extremely powerful in Incursion raids.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_START_2,"Nightcrawler fills Speed Bar for himself and his X-MEN allies, can Rebound Chain with infinite range, and clears all positive effects from all enemies while dealing tons of damage."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_WAVE2_0,"Back off, mon ami!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_WAVE2_1,"Looks like we got here just in time, oui?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_WAVE2_2,You two feel like taking out the trash?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_WAVE2_3,"Bring it, X-chumps!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_0,"Kurt, what was that about?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_1,"I confess I have no idea, Scott. They attacked without warning."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_2,Why didn't you teleport away?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_3,"I tried, but somehow I was prevented."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_4,Wasn't Sabretooth locked up in that ocean prison?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_5,"Actually, you're right. Who is this then?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_6,Look at this mark on his arm... I seen dis before. Mark of Sinister.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_7,So he's a clone?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_01_END_8,Great.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_INTRO_0,So we've got Sinister making clones again. But what are they after?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_INTRO_1,Sure could use the Professor and Cerebro right now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_INTRO_2,You know that isn't going to happen right now. But maybe someone else local could help.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_START_0,X-Men?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_START_1,"Looks like you could use some help, Herr Doctor!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_0,"Hmm. So let me get this straight, this Mister Sinister person is making clones and sending them to attack you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_1,Ja.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_2,"It's not the first time he's done this, but it's been awhile since we heard from him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_3,Why don't you get Charles to help? Why come to me?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_4,The Professor is... indisposed. We can't rely on him or Cerebro at the moment.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_02_END_5,"In that case, I'll do what I can."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_INTRO_0,"According to the divination spell I cast, we should be in the vicinity of where your clone came from."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_INTRO_1,"So 37 failed? No matter, the master will have what he desires one way or another."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_INTRO_2,Looks like dis the spot after all.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_START_0,You're not Emma Frost; are you another clone?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_START_1,"Thanks to my master, I am far more than my base template. Observe!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_0,She was a lot more powerful than Emma. Could Sinister be perfecting his plans to make super clones?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_1,Perhaps that is why they attacked me? To steal my blood?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_2,"Makes sense, but what I don't get is how he can control them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_3,"Emma is too powerful to be controlled by someone like Sinister, clone or not."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_4,Did you see her eyes? It's like the mind-controled forces Ultimus used to invade.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_5,So Mister Sinister somehow got his hands on Ultimus tech?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_03_END_6,That don't sound so good.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_INTRO_0,This must be one of Sinister's labs.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_INTRO_1,Let's see if we can find anything that might reveal his location.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_START_0,Uninvited guests. Luckily you don't need to be alive to extract your DNA...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_0,I can't fathom the purpose of these machines.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_1,We're going to need some specialized help with this.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_2,"Cyclops calling Forge. Come in, Forge."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_3,"I hear you, Cyclops. What do you need?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_4,Get to my location as fast as you can. We need your help to unravel a mystery.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_04_END_5,I'll be there as soon as I can.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_0,"You were right to call me. If I'm right, this is a hodgepodge of Ultimus tech and some other exotic cloning tech."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_1,"Frankly, I'm amazed it works. I have no idea how Sinister could create anything like this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_2,What does it do?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_3,"I'm not exactly sure yet, but I think these are prototypes. They increase the power of a clone's X-Gene."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_4,"And this one is similar to Ultimus' Conversion Device, but it's been modified."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_5,"I did get something useful though, coordinates for several of the active clones."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_INTRO_6,"Sounds like we have a job to do, mon ami."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_START_0,"This is Forge. A genius inventor, his mutant ability allows him to build fantastic tech and understand any tech he encounters."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_START_1,"As part of the X-Treme X-Men team, he excels in raids."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_START_2,"Forge provides tons of healing, positive effects, and Charged for X-MEN allies. In Raids, he also Revives X-TREME X-MEN allies."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_0,Thanks for the assist.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_1,"Bobby, what are you doing here?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_2,I was following a lead about the Professor.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_3,Oh? And any luck?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_4,"No, I think the whole thing was a trap set by these guys."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_05_END_5,Head back home and report in; Tell everyone no more solo-ops until we stop Sinister.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_INTRO_0,"Guten tag, friends. Perhaps you could use some help?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_INTRO_1,"Logan, look, it's Nightcrawler! We're going to win this fight by the sheer power of popularity!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_INTRO_2,"Wade, shut up and fight."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_END_0,"Logan, any luck with your mission?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_END_1,Gettin' attacked by a lot of these clones you warned us about.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_END_2,No leads on Sinister or the Professor yet. You think the two are connected?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_06_END_3,"Not sure, the timing doesn't match up, but keep searching and if you find anything let us know."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_INTRO_0,The tracker on the clones near here is reading different. Let's be careful.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_START_0,"We've been looking for you, Mr. Wagner. The master requires a sample of your X-Gene for his collection."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_MID_0,How is she so fast?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_END_0,I think we just witnessed an attempt at a hybrid. A clone of Psylocke with a hint of Quicksilver's speed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_END_1,"Pas bien, les amis. Sinister is getting closer to the perfect blend of spices."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_07_END_2,Looks that way.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_INTRO_0,I think we're closing in on another laboratory.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_INTRO_1,Let's be ready for anything.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_START_0,"Okay, I admit I should have been ready for this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_START_1,"I'm detecting incredible power from that clone of you, Scott. Off the charts."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_START_2,Try not to get hit by his optic blasts.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_MID_0,Must... destroy... the master... commands...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_MID_1,Please... stop me...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_MID_2,The clone is fighting the effect of the Conversion Machine somehow.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_MID_3,"It's slowing him down, stop him before he can attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_0,I think I figured out how he was so powerful. Let's open that containment capsule over there.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_1,"Uhhhh, my head..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_2,"Sunspot? Forge, is this a clone?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_3,I don't think so. The machine was charging him up somehow and letting the clone of you tap into that power.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_4,"Like a... power washer attached to a hose, if you will."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_5,"The clone was hyper-focusing Sunspot's energy, giving him those supercharged blasts."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_08_END_6,Let's get Sunspot back on his feet. We could use his help with the rest of the mission.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_INTRO_0,"How are you feeling, Sunspot?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_INTRO_1,Getting better. Mind filling me in on what's going on?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_INTRO_2,"Mister Sinister is making clones again, but this time he's got access to some tech he definitely shouldn't."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_INTRO_3,"If you're going after him, I want in."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_INTRO_4,I was thinking the same thing. Welcome to the team.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_START_0,This is Sunspot. His mutant powers allow him to absorb energy to increase his strength to incredible levels.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_START_1,"Along with his X-treme X-men teammates, he is very powerful in the Incursion raids."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_START_2,"Sunspot generates Ability Energy for all X-MEN, and provides a passive Damage boost for all X-TREME X-MEN. Both of these effects are amplified in Raids. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_START_3,"His abilities apply many negative effects, and his Ultimate clears 1 Charged from all enemies."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_0,That felt good.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_1,"Mon Ami, we gonna bring some big hurt to Mister Sinister with you on board."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_2,"Ja, einverstanden!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_3,I've narrowed down the possible sites and I've got a location on what I think is Sinister's main lab.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_4,Where are we headed?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_09_END_5,Antarctica.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_INTRO_0,What is zat?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_INTRO_1,"That, Kurt, is the Savage Land. We can't land the jet there, we've got to set down in the snow and head in on foot."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_INTRO_2,Why?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_INTRO_3,"Last time we left the jet unattended here, we had problems with a territorial T-Rex."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_INTRO_4,A what?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_START_0,Did you say T-Rex?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_10_START_1,It's hard to explain.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_INTRO_0,We're closing in on the coordinates.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_INTRO_1,We've got company!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_START_0,Time to die!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_START_1,What the?! They're not mutants.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_START_2,Looks like Mister Sinister been branching out.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_END_0,Sinister's making clones of non-mutants now?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_END_1,"Maybe they are another experiment, ja?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_END_2,"Forge, were they modified somehow?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_11_END_3,I don't think so. My guess is they were meant to slow us down. I'm detecting a huge power spike in the lab ahead of us.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_INTRO_0,"Ahh, welcome gentlemen! You have been quite the thorn in my side."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_INTRO_1,But those inferior prototypes are nothing compared to what I have prepared for you here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_INTRO_2,"Save it, Sinister. You're done. Where is the Professor?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_INTRO_3,"Why Mr. Summers, I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. I don't have your precious Professor."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_INTRO_4,I've got... something else!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_START_0,I... AM... POWER!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_START_1,How is he controlling a Phoenix?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_START_2,"It must be a Conversion Device, watch out she's fully powered!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_MID_0,"Give it up, Sinister!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_MID_1,"Never! First I'll destroy you, then I'll use your X-Genes to make the perfect chimaera!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_MID_2,I'll be UNSTOPPABLE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_0,It's over. Yield!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_1,"You may have won this battle, Summers, but there will be others!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_2,Not while you're sitting in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s jail.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_3,"Where did you get this Ultimus tech, Sinister? This is way beyond you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_4,"Oh, Scott, the ""Devil"" is in the details... HAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_5,"We not goin' get anything out of him, mon ami."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_6,"We need to find Xavier, dat be the only way we find out what's in his head."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_7,I think Gambit's right.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_8,Let's give him to S.H.I.E.L.D. to hold onto for now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_XTXM_12_END_9,"Alright. Forge, make the call."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_0,"Venom, grab that last tech bag, and let's get moving before the guards come!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_1,"Venom?\nHey, I'm talking to you!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_2,Quiet! We can hear something.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_3,What are you talking about?\nWe're the only one's here!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_4,"I hear it, too."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_5,Where's it coming from?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_INTRO_6,"Our minds. If we clear out these losers, I bet we'd hear it again."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_START_0,You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_START_1,Chow time!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_MID_0,Welcome to the party.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_MID_1,"Did you hear it, too?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_MID_2,We're all just getting a taste of the fun to come.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_END_0,"Spill it, Carnage. What do you know?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_END_1,I've heard this voice before. A delicious little whisper in a past steeped in black and red.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_END_2,It feels like something is slithering around in the back of my mind.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_END_3,It's controlling my body!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_01_END_4,We have no choice. We must obey!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_INTRO_0,Why is it making us go east?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_INTRO_1,Weren't you paying attention?\nIt wants us to prove ourselves.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_INTRO_2,We need the right warm-up match.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_START_0,"What is it, Viv?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_START_1,I have detected Symbiote lifeforms rapidly approaching.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_START_2,Now look at this. A family picnic.\nHow sweet.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_END_0,It speaks again!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_END_1,Go to that spot in space?\nWhat could be out there? It's a wasteland.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_END_2,We need more power?\nOminous much?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_02_END_3,This will be tricky.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_INTRO_0,THE BAXTER BUILDING...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_INTRO_1,"Welcome to the penthouse, baby! This is where the science is made."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_INTRO_2,What is that thing?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_INTRO_3,"Hey, be nice. Benny's very sensitive about his hideous looks since he became a rock."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_INTRO_4,"No, I mean that!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_START_0,"For once, Sue can't blame me for letting in trouble."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_MID_0,"Johnny, what's going on?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_MID_1,"No idea, but I'm pretty sure this is all Reed's fault."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_END_0,"It says we passed, but this doesn't feel like something I want to celebrate."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_END_1,This terminal is hooked up to a portal generator. We can use it to get to the new host.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_03_END_2,It was set to Asgard. Let's check there first.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_0,There he is.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_1,How can you tell which one he is?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_2,"""Silver Surfer"" doesn't spell it out for you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_3,He's surrounded by Asgardians.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_4,A bloodbath is a bloodbath. The donors are irrelevant.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_INTRO_5,Point taken.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_MID_0,"I know not what your motivations are, foul creatures, but you will not succeed!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_MID_1,Any harm that befalls my friends will be returned upon you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_END_0,No more struggling. Time to listen.\nAnd obey.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_END_1,I can hear it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_END_2,"Like a black hole in my mind, exerting its pressure on me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_END_3,*SQUELCH*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_04_END_4,There is no escaping the inevitable darkness.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_INTRO_0,Looks like you are already proving useful.\nWho is the next one on the list?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_INTRO_1,The voice demands we capture a Spider.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_INTRO_2,Not this again. They're everywhere.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_INTRO_3,"We must return to Earth and find them in New York, but they have many allies to defend them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_START_0,This guy? What's so good about him?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_START_1,Not him. He is a means to an end.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_START_2,"You know I can hear you, right? That stings."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_END_0,Let's just hit them all at once.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_END_1,"Together, they are formidable. Separated, they are easily provoked into mistakes."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_END_2,This flyer was in the Spider kid's pocket.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_05_END_3,"Come, time is of the essence."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_06_START_0,"Oi, uglies! This is an invite-only function!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_06_START_1,This will be quick.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_06_END_0,"I thought that one would draw her out.\nNo matter. This next one is a guarantee. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_06_END_1,These better not be random shots in the dark.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_07_START_0,I heard there was another attack at Hobie's show.\nBut it just had to be you guys.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_07_START_1,"No offense, but you all give me the major creeps."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_07_END_0,Their bark is always worse than their bite.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_07_END_1,Just wait until you get a load of me!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_START_0,You possess unique potential. We can unlock it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_START_1,There's no way I'm letting you get away with this!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_MID_0,Don't tell me these are more anomalies.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_MID_1,"No, they're much worse."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_0,Get everyone! We're not going to be able to stop them alone.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_1,The voice teaches us.\nWe give you a piece of Venom.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_2,No! Get this thing off of me!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_3,My skull feels like it's being ripped apart!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_4,Whose voice is that? I can't stand listening to it whisper!\nI'll fight you for as long as I can.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_5,*SQUELCH*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_08_END_6,Now this feels amazing!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_0,We need one more before we can leave this planet.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_1,"As much as I love watchin' people fight the bond, we need someone willing."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_2,I know the perfect target.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_3,He was caught trying to break into an A.I.M. facility to grab a Symbiote sample.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_4,We'll need to find out where they moved him to and the location of the facility.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_INTRO_5,I have an idea of who has the info.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_START_0,"The sooner we get what we want, the sooner we'll leave."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_START_1,Nothing's free in life. You gotta pay like everyone else.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_START_2,We'll see how you feel about that when we're done.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_END_0,"Ok, ok. I'll tell you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_END_1,"The Symbiote sample is still at the lab, but security has been increased."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_END_2,A heavily armored escort took off with your buddy. He's likely still being held by them.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_09_END_3,Tell me where they are.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_0,INSIDE THE A.I.M. FACILITY...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_1,"The closer we get, the more I can sense the sample."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_2,"That's not totally surprising. It is a sample of the Carnage Symbiote, after all."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_3,I'll take us straight to it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_4,No we have to be-
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_5,INTRUDERS!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_INTRO_6,- careful. Great.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_END_0,"Carnage, you're triggering every alarm as we go!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_END_1,I'm just tryin' to keep this party goin'.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_END_2,They had to have figured out what we were after. This won't be easy.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_10_END_3,I'm countin' on it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_0,"Come to papa, little fella!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_1,I'm not even going to say anything about that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_2,We need to move to the next location before they can enter lockdown.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_3,"Where's your heart, kid?\nInterrupting such a beautiful moment. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_4,*sob* Beautiful.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_11_END_5,"See, he gets it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_INTRO_0,This time we AREN'T attracting the attention of every person in the building!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_INTRO_1,What a waste!\nThis place looks really fun.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_INTRO_2,Stay close.\nAnd stay out of sight!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_START_0,See. There are barely any guards.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_START_1,I assure you we are enough.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_0,It's your lucky day. We're going to make your dream come true.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_1,What's the catch? What are you getting out of it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_2,You'll see.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_3,"The sample?! Hello, again, friend."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_4,*SQUELCH*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_5,A ship to go into deep space?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_12_END_6,"Let me think. Yes, I know exactly what we need for that."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_INTRO_0,There are some blueprints here and a ship that we'll need before we leave.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_INTRO_1,It's all experimental tech to reach new areas of space that few have traveled to.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_INTRO_2,"We grab those blueprints, and we're halfway to... wherever that voice is telling us to go."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_INTRO_3,We may have to get our hands a little dirty.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_INTRO_4,Count me in.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_START_0,It was around here somewhere.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_START_1,The Goblin's escaped! Sound the alarm!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_END_0,There's gotta be a Components list... Ah! Here it is!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_13_END_1,"Let's see, ""Biometric Tracking System""? I guess it's time for a little reunion."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_0,A SINISTER HIDEOUT...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_1,"I heard Lizard set him up. They say he is being held in a special facility, too. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_2,No way. Weren't they just working together?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_3,You could say that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_4,Osborn?! What happened to you?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_INTRO_5,You should be more worried about what's going to happen to you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_END_0,Did you really have to take down that whole building?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_END_1,It's the best invitation I could've sent him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_END_2,Hot off the press! Web-Heads causing mass amounts of property damage!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_END_3,"Wait, you're not..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_14_END_4,I always wanted to take you apart and see what made you tick.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_INTRO_0,That was hardly worth the build-up. Anyway...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_INTRO_1,Plug this in here. Connect these wires.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_INTRO_2,This should be enough to get us going in the right direction.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_INTRO_3,You won't be going anywhere.\nWe're culling this Symbiote outbreak.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_MID_0,Ping Weaver! They're going to get away.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_0,Weaver? I know that name.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_1,We got word from your friends that you were taken.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_2,AH! My head! Get this thing off me!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_3,She is ours.\nShe is one with the collective.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_4,I was able to keep you chattering long enough.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_15_END_5,Your friends can take it from here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_INTRO_0,"We'll get you out of there, kid!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_INTRO_1,Hold on!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_INTRO_2,There's something out in space. It's calling us to it!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_INTRO_3,You need to run! Get out of here and make sure you're ready to fight it!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_INTRO_4,Because I can't fight it anymore.\nI'm sorry.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_END_0,I couldn't stop them.\nThey still got away with her.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_END_1,Maybe we just haven't tapped every resource at our disposal.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_END_2,"No, no, no. I know what you're thinking."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_END_3,Something big is coming. You know we aren't going to be enough to stop it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_HIVEMIND_16_END_4,"Ay, ok, I'll call them. I'm starting to get my own headache."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_0,"Mysterio, I'm in need of your services."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_1,...Osborn? Is that you? Your suit looks like Stark-tech.\nWhat's going on?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_2,"I borrowed some of Stark's ideas and added my own genius. Recent events have allowed me to do something of a ""rebranding""."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_3,You may now call me the Iron Patriot!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_4,"S.T.R.I.K.E. and S.H.I.E.L.D. have fallen out of favor in Washington, and I've stepped in."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_5,"I'm now the head of the Homeland Agency for Monitoring, Managing, and Engaging Risk."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_6,It's H.A.M.M.E.R. time!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_7,"You really wanted that acronym, huh? What do you want from me?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_INTRO_8,"H.A.M.M.E.R. is only one part of my much larger plan. Gather the others, and listen close..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_START_0,You dare attack me? You won't live to regret this!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_START_1,Kill King of Atlantis. P.E.G.A.S.U.S. fight!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_0,"Hold fast, help is here!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_1,And you are?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_2,A friend. I'll explain after we win...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_3,This is Iron Patriot. As a member of the Cabal he is useful in Cosmic Crucible.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_4,"He helps the Cabal deal damage not only with his own abilities, but by debilitating the enemy team."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_WAVE2_5,"He has synergy with villains as a whole, so you can fill a Cabal team in with 2 members of your choosing to face different kinds of threats."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_0,Explain yourself.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_1,"Hello, your highness. My name is Norman Osborn. I'm sure you've heard of me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_2,Surface-dweller politics do not concern me. What do you want?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_3,"I'm forming something of an... alliance, if you will."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_4,For too long groups of heroes like the Avengers and S.T.R.I.K.E. have been a thorn in all our sides.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_5,"It's long past time those exceptional among us, possessed with great vision, got together ourselves."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_6,"And with the ""heroes"" reeling from the latest interdimensional calamity, that time to is now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_01_END_7,I'm listening...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_0,Your plan seems to have worked. The Atlantean is a powerful ally.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_1,"Merely the first of what will be a secret Cabal of untold power and influence, I assure you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_2,"Your illusionary P.E.G.A.S.U.S. team served its purpose, though your dialog could use work."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_3,"I couldn't find any decent reference material. I'm an illusionist, Norman, not a magician."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_4,"Indeed, speaking of which, I have more recruiting to do and you have your payment. Time for your disappearing act."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_INTRO_5,If you need my services again you know how to contact me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_START_0,Our next stop is Latveria.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_START_1,You intend to recruit Victor Von Doom?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_START_2,"What good is a secret cabal of the powerful elite without someone with the audacity to call himself ""DOOM""?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_END_0,"Be ready, Namor, we're nearly there."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_END_1," Doom is known for using robot body doubles. We want to make sure we're dealing with the genuine article."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_END_2,And how would you determine that?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_02_END_3,"Last I checked, robots can't wield magic. Find the one casting spells, and we've found the Doom we came for."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_START_0,Norman Osborn cosplaying as Iron Man? The livery of American jingoism is suited to a self-serving tycoon. You wear it well.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_START_1,"Now explain your presence in the House of DOOM. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_START_2,I've come to recruit you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_START_3,"Or, should I say, I've come to recruit Victor Von Doom, not his robot doppelganger. Fetch your master."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_MID_0,You are a fool to face me in my own domain!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_MID_1,If you're the real Doom prove your strength! Let us see some real magic!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_MID_2,Insolence!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_END_0,"So, it was a machine after all. For a toy, it put up a surprising fight."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_END_1,"If Doom's so-called toys were easy defeat, they wouldn't be particularly effective bodyguards. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_END_2,"S.T.R.I.K.E. tracked Doom's movements since he started causing interdimensional problems. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_END_3,And as Director of H.A.M.M.E.R.. I now have access to all those feeds.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_03_END_4,He's here. We just have to find him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_0,"Osborn! You sought Doom, and now he is before you. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_1,"You bested my guards, and battled through much for this audience."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_2,"Before I obliterate you, tell me why."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_3,Surely your many spies have informed you about the secret alliance of our mutual enemies?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_4,"Proud heroes in bright colors, operating behind closed doors, in the shadows... The Illuminati."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_5,I am aware. I also know they are no more.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_6,"Exactly. Some have vanished, others have gone their own way. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_7,Which means the time is right for a NEW alliance.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_8,"An alliance of the most powerful, most ambitious, most cunning. A... Cabal."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_INTRO_9,"This idea is not without merit. But first, prove to me you are any of these things. Prove you are worthy of Doom's valuable time."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_START_0,I have collected scores of these interdimensional cast-offs left behind by Ultimus' invasion.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_START_1,"Prove your power, ambition, and cunning by defeating them all. Then, perhaps, I will entertain your proposal."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_0,Well done. Your Cabal shall have Doom. For now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_1,"But know this: I expect your betrayal, Osborn. And when it comes I will annihilate you and seize this Cabal for myself."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_2,"I could say the same about you, Doom. Our reputations precede us. Distrust is natural. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_3,"But let me ask you, when you've peered out across the infinite and seen worlds beyond imagining... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_4,Have you ever seen one where we WIN?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_5,Or do our egos condemn us to defeat at the hands of an ever-increasing throng of do-gooders?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_6,"Because I've seen the data.  Every year, there are more of them. Eventually this eternal stalemate will be broken."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_04_END_7,"When that happens, I intend to win. And if I must share the spoils of victory to ensure it happens... I will."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_INTRO_0,"Samuel Sterns, my name is Norman Osborn. I've come to make you an offer."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_INTRO_1,I know who you are. The Iron Patriot moniker and your control of the latest alphabet agency don't fool me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_INTRO_2,"You're as well informed as I'd hoped. Good, that will make the recruiting pitch simpler..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_START_0,"This is The Leader. As a member of the Cabal, he is powerful in Cosmic Crucible."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_START_1,"As The Leader gains charge, your Cabal team will become more powerful. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_START_2,He also has stong synergy will villains as a whole to allow maximum theorycrafting!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_0,Norman's speech in Latveria was impressive. But do you truly believe any of it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_1,"I do not. I said I expect betrayal, and I do."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_2,"Osborn has no sense of honor. You, though, Namor... You and I shall forge an accord."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_3,"When the time is right, we destroy Osborn, seize his assets, subjugate the others and conquer the world."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_4,"You, Namor, with dominion over the seas. And Doom ruling the land, unopposed."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_05_END_5,I'm listening...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_INTRO_0,So you want me to be spymaster for this so-called Cabal? It's a fool's errand.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_INTRO_1,This collection of egos will never be able to function as a unit.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_INTRO_2,That is precisely why it WILL work!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_INTRO_3,"I see the rumors about your mental health weren't exaggerated. You're crazier than Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_INTRO_4,"I'm saner than I've been in years, Sterns. Come with us, and let me prove you wrong."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_START_0,"You all doubt we can work together, as you should. Words are meaningless, only actions matter."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_START_1,"So, I've prepared an assault on each of our foes. Where we lost individually, we'll triumph together."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_START_2,"And we start here, Sterns, with yours..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_MID_0,BIG BRAIN? HULK SMASH YOU AGAIN!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_MID_1,"Not this time. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_END_0,"I admit I am impressed, Osborn. This was an... apt demonstration."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_06_END_1,And we're only just getting started.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_INTRO_0,"Each of us has failed, in our own ways, to defeat our nemeses. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_INTRO_1,But I've brought us to New York today to rectify that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_INTRO_2,"With the help of my new agency, I've arranged for all our enemies to be centrally located today. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_INTRO_3,They're all in this city. Now is our time.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_START_0,"Hey pal, that's a copyrighted look. And it's ugly too."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_START_1,"Tony, whoever this guy is he's brought friends."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_START_2,"Cap, I think we've been brought here under false pretenses."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_MID_0,Anyone seen Banner? We could use some smash right about now!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_MID_1,"Hey guys, sorry I'm late, but I- WOAH, what the heck!?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_MID_2,"Watch out, kid!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_END_0,The Avengers are defeated...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_END_1,And now H.A.M.M.E.R. will keep them contained. That is the power of legitimacy. I've declared them a threat.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_END_2,"And now, that threat is neutralized and contained."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_END_3,"And what do we face next, ""Iron Patriot""? Which foe do you plan to defeat to convince Doom of your plan?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_07_END_4,"Oh, I've got an idea. It's pretty fantastic..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_INTRO_0,Richards?! You plan to defeat Reed Richards in order to try and sway me?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_INTRO_1,"Then why not now, when we have extra incentive?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_INTRO_2,"He's currently isolated on Ultimus' mothership, locked away as he conducts his experiments. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_START_0,Victor? Namor? What's going on here?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_END_0,"And there you have it, Doom. Do you see it now? Do you see the power of us working together?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_END_1,"Richards in ruin... S.T.R.I.K.E. at our feet... Doom has sought these for some time. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_END_2,"And we're just getting started. We've chased the Avengers and Fantastic Four off, now we take care of the rest!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_END_3,"H.A.M.M.E.R. is a legitimate front, but in secret, the Cabal controls it. And the world!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_08_END_4,"The world? Is THAT the limit of your imagination, Osborn?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_INTRO_0,I have desired access to Ultimus's ship and its secrets since his invasion began.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_INTRO_1,"With it, I can rule over all of creation. And you have finally delivered it to me!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_INTRO_2,"Oh. Shocking. Doom is turning on us. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_INTRO_3,If only a certain gamma irradiated super genius had seen this coming from the very beginning...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_START_0,With the secrets aboard this ship I will be unstoppable!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_START_1,"Leader, I need you with me. It's him or us!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_WAVE2_0,"I have an idea! Using the ship's interdimensional drive, we can strand Doom into the void between universes!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_WAVE2_1,"We'll keep him busy, get on it!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_WAVE3_0,Fools! You think you can defeat ME?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_WAVE3_1,"We don't have to, all I need to do is attune the ship to your unique energy frequency..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_WAVE3_2,What?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_0,"So long, Doom! Not a bad plan you had, Osborn. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_1,Oh? I'm sure I don't know what you mean...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_2,In one move you've rid yourself of a powerful rival AND given the rest of us cause to ally against a common foe.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_3,And demonstrated that we are more powerful together than apart in the process. Bravo.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_4,Very well. But let this be the whole of The Cabal. We can use others as pawns as necessary...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_5,But Doom's betrayal highlights the danger of bringing in more... unstable allies into the inner circle.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_6,"I couldn't have said it better myself. We can split the world among us. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_7,"One problem remains though. Doom isn't gone for good. The void between universes isn't empty, he could return."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_CABAL_09_END_8,"We have plenty of time to prepare for that. If he comes back, we'll be ready..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_0,"BRITAIN, THE 14TH CENTURY..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_1,"Hark, Demons! I've slain many of you this day. Lay down your arms and you shall be spared."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_2,"You have the word of Sir Percy, of the Round Table."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_3,You got any idea what this talkin' tin can is saying?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_4,"Brother, I don't even know where we are. Let's fill him full of lead and figure it out later."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_INTRO_5,Then you've chosen the Ebony Blade! Have at thee!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_START_0,BLACK KNIGHT IS A NOBLE PROTECTOR WHO FIGHTS BACK AGAINST ENEMIES THAT THREATEN HIM AND HIS ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_START_1,"BLACK KNIGHT'S <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITIY</color> IS A POWERFUL RETALIATE ATTACK, WHICH USES <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color>  TO DEAL DAMAGE BASED ON HIS MAXIUM HEALTH."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_WAVE2_0,What pit hath you beasts climbed from?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_WAVE2_1,"Ha, didn't expect so many of us, did ya?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_WAVE2_2,"Oh, I was just about to say that to YOU."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_WAVE2_3,"You don't know us, Knight, but we're here to help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_0,Noble knights with shields and no blades? These are strange days indeed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_1,"Verily, though, I am grateful for thine help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_2,This guy is just as longwinded as Thor. What century do they start speaking English in England?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_3,"Hey, aren't ninja supposed to be SILENT, Clint?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_4,"Like those invaders you've been fighting off, we're not from around here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_01_END_5,And we need your help getting home.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_0,"After we discovered Osborn struck a deal and altered reality, we went after Mephisto."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_1,"He was ready for us, though, and before we even had a chance to strike he threw us through time. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_2,"Whatta revoltin' development. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_3,"I agree, my stone-skinned friend. But how can I, a knight, help you fight off the devil himself?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_4,"Your sword is a powerful mystical artifact, Sir Percy. Well, the mystical is exactly what we're dealing with. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_5,"My Ebony Blade is yours, but if it's the mystical you seek... It's Merlin to whom we should speak."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_INTRO_6,"Great, he's RHYMING now. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_START_0,"Wha... Camelot in flames?! And monsters through the ramparts?! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_START_1,"We've got your back, Knight!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_02_START_2,RAAAAGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_INTRO_0,"If the walls were breached, Merlin may be in danger. We must get to his chambers."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_INTRO_1,"Uh, guys? Merlin's chambers wouldn't happen to be that way would it? Just past..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_INTRO_2,Your DOOM.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_START_0,"You seek to... Inconvenience... Doom. Surrender and be destroyed quickly. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_START_1,"Vic, no matter what century it is, I tell ya... As soon as I see yer ugly mug?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_START_2,IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_0,"Wow, we defeated Doctor Doom... Kind of easily?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_1,Defeat? This was but a minor setback.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_2,"Grimm, I will find you and your friends soon, and there will be a reckoning."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_3,"Hey! Get back here, ya no good bag a' bolts!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_4,"Weaker, and he didn't seem to recognize us... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_5,A younger version of Doom?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_6,"Time travel, ugh! See, this is why I never touch the stuff."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_7,But why would a young Doom be in Camelot?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_03_END_8,He was here serving his mistress... Morgan Le Fay!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_INTRO_0,Le Fay! Befouling Merlin's chambers with your dark magic? Attacking Camelot itself!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_INTRO_1,"Even for you, this ambition extends beyond your ability."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_INTRO_2,"Oh, dear Sir Percy. Always so short sighted. I'm hardly alone. I've got friends..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_INTRO_3,"In LOW places. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_START_0,Mephisto!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_START_1,"Oh, you sound so surprised! Did you think I sent you back here by mistake?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_START_2,"I'm busy with plans you can't comprehend, so I'll let Morgan here handle you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_START_3,"With a power little boost from me! Hahaha! Good luck, heroes!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_0,"You are bested, Morgan! Surrender, your siege is at its end."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_1,Oh... You think... This is the end?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_2,"Hey, should that big terrifying book be glowing quite so much?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_3,"Mephisto gave me one last spell in case of this outcome. If this is the end, then I banish you to the very beginning!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_4,"To before history itself!\n\nGoodbye, heroes!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_5,"Hold on, everyone!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_04_END_6,[FWOOOSH!]
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_0,Ugh. Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_1,I think you mean...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_2,Don't say it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_3,...'WHEN are we?'
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_4,"Well, WHENever it is... Why do they have a Hulk?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_INTRO_5,RAAARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_START_0,Shouldn't he be green?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_START_1,"I'm just glad he's not attacking US. Time to lend him a hand, Avengers."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_START_2,"A PREHISTORIC BRAWLER WITH A COSMIC POWER, STARBRAND DEALS BRUTAL <color=#fff568>BONUS ATTACKS</color> WITH ALL THREE OF HIS ACTIVE ABILITIES."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_START_3,"HIS UNSTOPPABLE <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> IGNORE ENEMY <color=#fff568>STEALTH</color> AND <color=#fff568>TAUNT</color> EFFECTS, LEAVING NOWHERE TO HIDE."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_END_0,"So, do you speak, big fella?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_END_2,"That answers that. I guess we're not going to get a lot of answers out of you, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_05_END_3,"The Starbrand prefers action. I, the Black Panther, speak for him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_0,"Starbrand, myself, and others like us were thrown together through circumstance."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_1,"Now we stand for those in our world who cannot stand for each other. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_2,"Sounds familiar. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_3,My home is under siege. The Starbrand is helping me defend it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_06_INTRO_5,"Sounds like Avengers business to me. Lead the way, Panther."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_INTRO_0,Stranded from the future?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_INTRO_1,"Not long ago I would think you mad. But we have had dealings with this devil. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_INTRO_2,Then you know we need to stop him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_END_0,"Unfortunately, this is beyond even my knowledge. You may be trapped here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_END_2,Something stirs in the goliath. What doth he want?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_END_3,He's not... Hungry... Is he?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_07_END_4,"He seems interested, friend. In the black blade you carry. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_0,"The Ebony Blade... I feel it drawn to him. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_1,"The Star Brand is an ancient power. We do not know its origin, or its limits."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_2,The blade and the brand... They seem to be conversing?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_3,"If their power combined could get us out of here, let's give them time to talk."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_4,[HORNS BLARE]
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_5,"We may have less than you thought, my friend. That alarm comes from the Panther Tribe! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_INTRO_6,"We save them, then ourselves. We're with you, Panther."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_START_0,"You have chosen the wrong land to attack, invaders!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_START_1,Wakanda forever!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_START_2,"I suppose some things never change, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_0,"The Star Brand and the Ebony Blade... They crackle with power! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_1,A lot of sound and fury... But we're still here?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_2,We're missing something. We need another power source?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_3,Or a wizard?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_4,We need a miracle.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_5,Seems like what you really need...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_6,[VROOOOOM]
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_08_END_7,...is a lift. 'Sup.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_0,Ghost Rider?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_1,This ain't no Ghost Rider I ever seen.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_2,"Yeah, Grimm. That's 'cause I'm from the way future. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_3,"Big deal. This is the stone age, we're also from the future."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_4,"I said WAY future! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_5,"I'm gathering Avengers to stop Mephisto. If we have a chance, you gotta come with me now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_6,To where?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_7,"To the edge of the Multiverse... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_INTRO_8,"To Infinity's End. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_START_0,"This is it... Where every dimension bleeds together. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_START_1,Looks like we're not alone.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_START_2,"Cosmic castaways. They ain't friendly! Dukes up, everyone!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_START_3,"FLUNG BACK FROM THE FAR FUTURE, COSMIC GHOST RIDER IS A TERRIFYING CONTROLLER, READY TO PUNISH ENEMY STATUS EFFECTS."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_START_4,"HIS ACTIVE ABILITIES DEAL EXTRA DAMAGE FOR EACH POSITIVE STATUS EFFECT ON HIS TARGET, WHILE HIS <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> PUNISHES ENEMIES WHO ATTACK BEFORE HIS TEAM IN <color=#fff568>WAR</color>."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_END_0,"You were pretty quick to trust me there, Cap."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_END_1,"Well, despite everything, I've always known you to be a decent man deep down... Lt. Castle."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_END_2,What?! How the hell'd you know it was me?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_END_3,"I might be at the end of everything, but I can still recognize a Marine. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_09_END_4,"Heh. You're all right, Cap.\n\nSemper freakin' fi. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_0,"INFINITY'S END, THE EDGE OF EVERYTHING..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_1,Soon... No longer bound to just the hell of Nexus... I'll possess the power of ALL HELLS in the multiverse!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_2,"I can't say I like the sound of that. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_3,Wha...?!\n\nHow did you escape the past?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_4,"Good, old-fashioned American determination."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_5,"And a magic motorcycle. You're going down, Mephisto."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_6,"Well, well, Frank Castle, the prodigal rider! Come back to do my bidding? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_INTRO_7,"Nah, that's over. And soon, you're gonna be too. Lock and load, Avengers."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_START_0,"You gathered Avengers from across time, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_START_1,Not a bad trick! Let's try it... With some of MY friends! HAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_END_0,"Merging all the hells, becoming basically a god... He can't ACTUALLY do that, can he?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_END_1,"He's the literal Devil and we're fighting him in the future in between multiverses. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_END_2,You really want to find out?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_10_END_3,Fair point.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_0,"Mephisto! We're sending you back to the pit! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_1,"Of all the souls I've had the displeasure to meet, Rogers, your incorruptible one is the most BORING."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_2,"Your friends, though... Now THEY'RE interesting."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_3,HISSSS!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_4,FOR MEPHISTO.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_5,"I'm POWERED by souls! Some of you costumed idiots were nice enough to trade me theirs. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_INTRO_6,Good luck!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_START_0,HAHAHAHahahahaHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_START_1,"Is it wrong that I like Osborn MORE now? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_0,"Nova, Black Cat... Listen to us."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_1,"Yer a good guy, Richie. I know you wouldn't have delt with this jamoke if it wasn't the only way to save lives."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_2,"And whatever ambition drove you to do this, Felicia... You're better than this. You're not the worst part of you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_3,"No matter what, you're heroes. And when every fiber of your being is pulling you away from what's right?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_4,You do the right thing instead. Because that's what heroes do.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_5,"AAAAAARGH... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_6,"Ugh. Sorry, Cap. We're with you now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_11_END_7,"Let's turn Mephisto into a scratching post. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_0,"Oh, boo. Only Osborn's black soul withstood your little rallying cry?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_1,"How... PREDICTABLE. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_2,"But you're too late! An endless rank of the damned are at my disposal! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_3,"Soon, I'll be the ruler of EVERYTHING! What do you say to that?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_4,"Just one thing, I suppose."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_INTRO_5,Avengers...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_START_0,ASSEMBLE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_0,"Avengers gathered from across time, across dimensions! And all you managed to do was ANNOY me. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_1,"Heh, we weren't ever going to completely defeat your army. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_2,OBVIOUSLY! What did you think you  WERE you doing?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_3,"Buying time. For THEM. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_4,"Hello, Brother. Time for us to have a TALK... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_5,"What... Wait, no! NO!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_6,"I figured they weren't gonna be too pleased about you trying to take over their turf. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_7,"So, I made a deal with the devils. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_8,NOOOOOOOOO!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_9,"Have fun in the Dark Dimension, pal. I'll see you in hell. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_10,"Heh, always wanted to say that. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_11,"Great, now just gotta keep an eye out for INFINITY other Mephistos runnin' around."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_12,"We kept the world out of the hands of the devil. That's a clear a win as you get in my book. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_OOT_12_END_13,Avengers... Let's go home.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_0,NEW YORK CITY...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_1,"Alright Wade, only one more mercenary base, and then we're done with S.T.R.I.K.E.'s hit list for the night."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_2,FINALLY. These guys are so booooooring! Can't we at least face off against some bad guys with dialog?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_3,The only thing I want to hear from these guys is 'I surrender'.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_INTRO_5,SEE?! This is what I'm talking about!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_START_0,"Put your hands up and weapons down, you silent, glowing-eyed goons!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_MID_0,Mind if we join the party?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_MID_1,"Who the FUZZ are these guys?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_MID_2,Where is this party they're talking about?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_MID_3,And why are they SO handsome?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_END_0,"Odd. Our intel didn't mention anything about rogue Deadpools. And they didn't seem corrupted, either."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_END_1,Maybe SOMEONE just forgot to make our enemies' eyes red? It happens more often than you think.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_END_2,Hey! They left behind this cool looking machine that I'm DEFINITELY going to turn on without even thinking about it. Oops!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_01_END_3,"Wait, Wade! Don't!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_INTRO_0,THE HELICARRIER...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_INTRO_1,"Director Fury, the Helicarrier is approaching the Incursion site. Should be in view shortly."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_INTRO_2,Prep a team. I want to be ready when we get there. Any word from our X-Force team?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_INTRO_3,"Nothing yet, sir.  Hoping to get word fr- Wait.  We've just been boarded! Multiple hostiles, heading towards the bridge!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_INTRO_4,"Sorry to interrupt, Director Fury. But my friends and I will be taking over from here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_START_0,Ultimus? How the hell are you here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_START_1,"You're not the only one with allies, Fury. Now, stronger than ever, I claim Nexus Earth for Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_MID_0,Hi! Fury... Esteemed bad guys... Love to see you all.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_MID_1,"Um, Fury can we chat real quick? I may have done a slight, teeny tiny, insignificant... Oopsie."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_MID_2,"Kind of in the middle of something! Help us out here and we can talk all you want. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_0,"Bridge contained, but that won't hold them for long. Wilson, do you have ANY idea of what's happening on my Helicarrier?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_1,"So, funny story - you're gonna love this - it might actually be MY fault the Multiverse's worst boyband is here!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_2," See, it started with me going on a joyride with a time machine..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_3,A WHAT? Who in the HELL let you have a time machine?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_4,"It wasn't Cable's, I swear! I found it on the corpse of someone way less hot than Nate."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_5,"If you STILL have a TIME MACHINE, what are you doing HERE? Fix this! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_02_END_6,"FIX IT! Of COURSE! This is why I come to you, Fury! You've always got the best ideas. No depth perception, but GREAT ideas."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_0,THE RECENT PAST...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_1,"Ah, the non-specific recent past! I can't believe you came with me, Fury! I'm touched!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_2,"I'm HERE to make sure you fix whatever it is you did. To do that, we're going to need an expert. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_3,"Let me guess! Sam Beckett! Marty McFly? No, wait, don't tell me... Did you get us a Hot Tub Time Machine?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_4,"No, a real person. I'm talking about Kestrel. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_5,"She's an expert in diverging timelines, and this should be around the time that she just returned to S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_6,And I bet there was soooooo much paper work! Let's see if she's still filling out forms.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_INTRO_7,"For once that's a good idea, lets go."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_START_0,"Fury, do you know if I'm supposed to elect for the S.T.R.I.K.E. HMO or the S.H.I.E.L.D. dental? Or both?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_START_1,"I'm an astrophysicist and this is still SO confusing. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_START_2,Don't worry about that now! There's a well designed and very cool fight at this exact moment! What a coincidence!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_0,"Done! Hopefully there were some decent rewards this time...Now, where were we?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_1,You were just about to ask me to help you all with time travel shenanigans.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_2,Hey! How'd you know?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_3,"Armor lets me see timelines, remember? You two are from the future. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_4,That's exactly right. We need your help putting our future right.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_5,"Fury I don't understand, how did the timeline get disturbed to begin with?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_6,"Let's just say it was unfortunate circumstances. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_03_END_7,Hi! I'm unfortunate circumstances!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_0,"So, you think you have a way to fix our timeline? And you're nearly done syncing the time machine tech to your portal gun to do it?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_1,Yes. Why are you talking like that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_2,Shhh... It's exposition.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_3,"Okay... Well, if those villains are free, we should travel through time to the points where you defeated them. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_4,"Make sure it happens how you remember it, and boom! No more bad guys. Easy."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_INTRO_5,"Oh, sure! I bet this will work out swell. It's not like there's 12 more missions or anything. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_START_0,"Ah, Fury, Kestrel... The other one. We've been expecting you. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_START_1,"""The other one""?! How DARE you, sir. I have TWO movies and a third on the way!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_START_2,"Aw, crud. It looks like we didn't go far back enough and the timeline's still altered! Well, its now or never, lets take 'em down!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_0,"Game's over, Ultimus. Give it up. Who interfered in the timeline and freed your big blue butt?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_1,Fine... I'll tell you. But only because he's so annoyi- ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_2,"Oops! Can't have Ultimus spilling those beans, it's too early! We still have 3 more chapters left!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_3,Hey! I already made a reference to that! Who the heck are you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_4,I'm the one setting the multiverse right! Toodles!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_5,"He's escaping through a portal to your time! Quick, don't let them get away!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_6,PRESENT DAY...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_7,"Well, I'm not seeing the Blue Guy, Purple Guy, or Fire Demon! That's a good sign."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_8,"Director Deadpool, there you are. We need your help deciding what color streamers to put up for the party."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_9,DIRECTOR Deadpool?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_01_04_END_10,BUM BUM BUUMMMMMM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_0,"Oh, HELL no. We are not doing ""Director Deadpool"". Kestrel, we need to fix this before he destroys S.T.R.I.K.E. for good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_1,"Well, well, well, it's a MUTINY, eh? I'll have you drawn and quartered for this, Mr. Fury!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_2,"Sorry, I've gone mad with power. Please continue."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_3,"If that Deadpool is grabbing villains and dragging them all over time, we could start by tracking them. Who's your best tracker?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_4,"Normally I'd call in Wolverine, but since it's Thanos we're tracking... Deathpool. She's been hunting Thanoses her whole life."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_5,"Ooh, that's a tough one. She and I had a bit of a daddy-daughter disagreement recently. Had to ground her for ""reaping the haters"". Kids today!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_INTRO_6,"Well, if you two aren't getting along now... We just go back to when S.T.R.I.K.E. recruiter her, just like how you all found me. Let's go."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_START_0,"A MONASTARY, NEPAL, ANOTHER EARTH..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_START_1,"I might be too late for this Earth's Deadpool, Thanos. But I am going to enjoy killing you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_START_2,"Aw, here she is, killing Thanos! *sniff* I'm still so proud. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_START_3,Wait... Dad? There's more than one of you in this reality?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_START_4,Talk later! Scythe now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_END_0,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_01_END_1,"It's a long story, I'll explain in between Missions to save time. People are playing this in the bathroom at work, after all. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_INTRO_0,"Phew! That's basically it! We need your help to fix the future. Once we've done that, you can go back to hunting down the Kool-Aid Man. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_INTRO_1,"You mean Thanos? He's purple. The Kool-Aid Man is red. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_INTRO_2,"There's more than one kind of Kool-Aid! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_INTRO_3,"Okay, fine. I'll help. It sounds like at the very least... I'll get to spend a little more time with someone who reminds me of my dad. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_INTRO_4,"Aww. See? The people making this game do have a heart. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_START_0,"Hey, big guy! I know we're early, but what do you say we handle this whole ""kill every version of me"" now?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_START_1,Deadpool. I always have time to kill you. And who are your friends?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_START_2,We're the end of your eggplant emoji lookin' face! Let's do this!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_0,"Finally... Revenge! Every movie and TV show I've seen about it was wrong, this is gonna feel GREAT. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_1,"Wait! You can't kill him. We're trying to fix the timeline. In our time, you brought him back to your home dimension."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_2,That really doesn't sound like me... Death is right in my name.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_3,"You had a whole character arc! It was so moving, socially awkward nerds with hoodies and beards had to dry tears off their phones!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_4,"Okay, so... I drop him off, then we hunt down the stray Thanos from your time? How does that make sense?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_02_END_5,"We'll figure it out! Or the people paid to write this story will. Or they won't! I saw on Reddit that they're VERY lazy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_0,"Is this the place? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_1,"Yes, but... something's off. I feel the Infinity Stones, and Thanos's essence. But not necessarily Thanos himself?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_2,"Finally, some backup! We've got a big problem -- one of the Three Dooms has the Infinity Stones. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_3,"Hey, more than one Doom! The Infinity Gauntlet! I remember this!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_4,"Yeah, it... Just happened? Three Dooms, all wielding incredibly powerful weapons. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_5,"The part giving me the most trouble, though, is that they're not alone. They've got a weird Deadpool with them."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_INTRO_6,"A weird and SEXY Deadpool, you mean!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_03_START_0,You'll never reach our masters! Doom's Web Warriors will see to that!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_INTRO_0,"Hey, quick question... Who's this Doom guy? Thanos is kind of my specialty, I haven't dealt with him before."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_INTRO_1,"Well, he's extremely rich, he's got very cool armor, and he talks about himself in the third person. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_INTRO_2,(And not just because there's three of him.)
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_INTRO_3,There are indeed... More than enough Dooms to destroy you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_START_0,Youuuu don't belong heeerreee...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_START_1,"And we don't just mean Castle Doom. Curious. We'll have to dissect you and see what makes you TICK. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_0,"Okay, S.T.R.I.K.E.'s dealt with Doom, Thanos seems to be back where he belongs... It's possible we fixed the time stream?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_1,"Glad to hear it. Let's head back to our time and deal with our little ""Director Deadpool"" problem."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_2,Hey! That's BIG Director Deadpool to you!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_3,PRESENT DAY...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_4,"Director Deadpool, thank goodness we found you. The party's about to start!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_5,"Great. Still a mess. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_6,"You're telling me, these decorations are HIDEOUS! Say, what's this party for, anyway?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_7,You don't know? It's our Sixth Anniversary party!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_8,Six years since your victory over Ultimus and appointment to supreme commander of all of Nexus Earth's defenses!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_02_04_END_9,"OKAY! EVERYONE, BACK IN THE PORTAL!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_0,This is giving me a headache! The timeline is more tangled than my Slinky after I dropped it down some stairs!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_1,"They say you're SUPPOSED to do that, I still don't know what went wrong!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_2,"A tangle... Okay, that gives me an idea. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_3,"Spider-Weaver. She can interact with the Web of Life and Destiny! That should be immune to whatever changes are happening. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_4,"Oooh, and her glowy web things will make PERFECT string lights for the party!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_INTRO_5,Let's go!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_START_0,"Lost spiders, don't lose hope. I'm here to protect you, and... Excuse me? Who are you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_START_1,"Hey, girl... We're here to ask for a little help. Oh ew! Is that Doc Ock? Lets take care of him first."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_START_2,"Hey! I may be an evil scientist, but I still have FEELINGS!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_END_0,"Time travel. Deadpool... I see. I did sense something wrong with the Web. This could explain it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_01_END_1,Do you know which universe the Deadpool causing you trouble originates from?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_INTRO_0,We haven't been able to pin him down long enough to figure it out. We just need more time.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_INTRO_1,Time you WILL not get! Prepare to die!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_START_0,My master in the Dark Dimension demands you stop this pursuit.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_START_1,"So, in the name of Dormammu, I, Baron Karl Mordo shall be your end!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_START_2,Did he just say his name is KARL?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_END_0,"Why is Dormammu so concerned with this, Mordo? What business does he have in this plane?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_END_1,"All I know is he told me with urgency, almost fear that I must stop you. Now I've failed. I'm a dead man."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_02_END_2,"If Dormammu is involved, he's our best lead. Prepare yourselves, we're about to journey to the Dark Dimension."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_03_INTRO_0,"The thread leads here, there is certainly something very wrong happening deep in the Dark Dimension."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_03_INTRO_1,"Too bad this is as far as you go, lady. Let me give you a ride outta here... And straight to hell!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_03_END_0,"We're nearly there, our fate has a strong connection to what's ahead, brace yourselves."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_INTRO_0,Dormammu's just ahead. And he's not alone.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_INTRO_1,"You're seriously not gonna help me out here, Dormy? I thought we had a deal!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_INTRO_2,"What purpose do I, the Dread One, have in stalling a group of time travelers? Your petty dealings do not concern me."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_INTRO_3,"What if I told you they called you Flambe Head? They said you'd make a killing at Benihana renting yourself out as an onion volcano. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_INTRO_4,"Oh and look there they are now! Good luck, Dormy!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_START_0,I wield the Flames of the Faltine! My head is not a chef's parlor trick! I will not be compared to an onion!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_0,"It was not your destiny to help Deadpool, Dread One. Tell us what changed. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_1,"He played to my vanity. Besides, it gets dull in the Dark Dimension. I can only astral project and prank Wong so many times. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_2,"""Do you have The Sacred Essence of The Ancient One in a can?"" He falls for it every time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_3,What do you know about him? Tell us and we'll leave without further conflict.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_4,"The small one told me to delay you. That he needed ""an epic beverage run"" for a celebration."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_5,"If he's planning a multi-dimensional celebration, there's only one place that's going to have that much food and drink..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_03_04_END_6,"Asgard. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_INTRO_0,"Thor's probably working for Deadpool, and I'm not trusting a Loki... Who do we know that can break us into Asgard?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_INTRO_1,Of course! Vahl!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_INTRO_2,We can find them battling Hela in their original universe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_INTRO_3,"Smart! When they gained Sovereign's power, they could travel across realities. Exactly what we need."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_INTRO_4,Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_START_0,"S.T.R.I.K.E.! My friends. I am glad that you have arrived. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_START_1,"Okay, who ruined the surprise? I can't stand spoilers!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_START_2,"No one, good jester. First, help me claim what is mine and I will help you find your mischievous time traveler."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_0,"Thank you for your aid. Now, to deal with your Deadpool problem."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_1,"Yeah, how'd you know about that? We just got here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_2,"I have a deep, abiding connection to both the Phoenix Force and Odinforce. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_3,It provides me an unalterable sense of self that is anchored to the multi-dimensional fabric of the universe.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_4,"Oh yeah? Well, I have... TWO costumes. A red one AND a grey one. Beat that."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_01_END_5,"You see more than others believe you do, good friend. Exactly what makes your counterpart so dangerous. We must make haste! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_0,We may be able to stop this Deadpool before he loots this universe's Asgard. Though... Something is already amiss here.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_1,"I sense it, too. The destiny of Asgard is blurry. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_2,"There! Deadpool, he's already altering this time line!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_3,"I TOLD you, someone told me I could take these casks of mead! Someone important. Not like, DIRECTOR important, but the Asgardian equivalent."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_4,No Asgardians remain here! Only us! And we do not take thievery lightly...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_5,"Oh, actually, it was them! That group of weirdos told me I could take all this stuff. Take it up with them!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_INTRO_6,"See ya, chumps!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_START_0,"We do not know who you are, but with our supplies stolen we're VERY hungry... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_0,An Asgard overrun by symbiotes and pirates... if only I were able to help them sooner.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_1,"I'm sorry Vahl, but right now we have to focus on Deadpool. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_2,He's always one step ahead of us. It's like he's...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_3,...from the FUTURE! Of course! It's a TIME TRAVEL story!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_4,"Dad, didn't this all start when you found a time machine? What if a future version of you decided to keep it?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_02_END_5,Then we go back to before he got it! Genius.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_0,"NEXUS EARTH, MOMENTS BEFORE DEADPOOL ACQUIRES THE TIME MACHINE..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_1,"REMEMBER BACK THEN? MISSION ONE? MAN, WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_2,"WHERE DOES THE TIME GO? THE YEARS START COMIN ', AND THEY DON'T STOP COMIN'..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_3,"Hel-lo! What do you think you're doing? Only I get to talk to the player. Yeesh! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_4,SORRY. *AHEM*\n\nNEXUS EARTH...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_5,"Ok, based on this device's history, Spider-Weaver's reading from the Knot of Destiny, and Vahl's perception from the Odinforce..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_6,AND our daughter-daddy psychic bond!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_7,Sure... We know that we're moments away from Deadpool making initial contact with the time travel device right here. We stop it from happening...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_INTRO_8,"And you'll officially be a bunch of party poopers! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_START_0,"Oh, come on, you think I don't remember trying this?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_START_1,I'm absolutely going to make sure past me finds the time machine and gives me the authority to do whatever I want!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_START_2,"And then I'm going to have a big party and jump out of a cake! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_START_3,"For the good of the timeline, and for our sanity! This ends now!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_END_0,"I'm destroying this thing, once and for all. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_END_1,No! My time machine! It was only one week from retirement...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_END_2,Now we just need to stop old you from getting it to begin with...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_03_END_3,Wade! It looks like there's one more squad of corrupted enemies over here!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_INTRO_0,Wait! We're not corrupted!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_INTRO_1,"Look, I'd love to believe you, but there's a LOT of Deadpools kicking around right now. My gut says shoot first and chat later."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_START_0,"Last chance, hand over the shiny thing! I want to press all of the buttons!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_START_1,I have to fight ANOTHER version of myself? Do you know how much THERAPY I'm going to need?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_START_2,And the S.T.R.I.K.E. Insurance is NOT going to cover it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_START_3,I KNEW it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_0,Owwww! I guess those fancy spider legs aren't just for show. No wonder you have that crazy miss chance.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_1,[SMASH!]
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_2,"FINALLY. Time machine, no more. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_3,"What, no, then that means I'll never exist! I'm... I'm... Melting! Melting! What a world, what a world... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_4,"Gross! Wait, why am I still here? You know what? I don't want to know. I choose ignorance! Hooray, ignorance!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_5,"If it makes you feel better, Dad... you looked really cool as director while it lasted. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_6,You just weren't very good at it. All you focused on were parties!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_7,"It would have been a really sweet party... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_8,"Well, let's get back to the Helicarrier in our time. I hear it's S.H.I.E.L.D. Medic's birthday! Maybe there'll be cake in the break room?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_6YA_04_04_END_9,It's not the same...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_INTRO_0,The Spiders followed us again!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_INTRO_1,There's nowhere you can go that we can't follow.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_INTRO_2,No more runnin'! They need a lesson in blood.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_INTRO_3,You wanna dance?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_START_0,Get this thing off of me!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_START_1,SHUT UP!\nI'm in control here!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_START_2,"Not for long, leech."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_MID_0,"I have opened another portal, but we do not have much time."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_MID_1,Leave her behind! She's not worth slowin' down over.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_0,I'm never letting go!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_1,We figured you would say that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_2,This doodad emits a high-frequency pitch that you symbiotes seem to hate.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_3,*CLICK*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_4,SKREEE!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_5,Got ya!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_6,We can't let them reach their goal.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_01_END_7,Catch your breath first. We can give chase when you're ready.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_INTRO_0,The Venom sample has been contained. Where are they going?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_INTRO_1,"A dead planet, I think. I fought the voice too much to be given any more information."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_INTRO_2,"Weaver, where did they go?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_INTRO_3,Not far. They jumped right into the city.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_INTRO_4,Perfecto. I'll send the location out with a call for backup.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_START_0,Got the jump on ya!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_START_1,Cute. You're making friends.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_END_0,Make another portal! NOW!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_END_1,They will follow-
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_END_2,GET. US. OUT. OF. HERE.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_END_3,Heh. Sounds like there's trouble in paradise.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_02_END_4,The Surfer wasn't lying. We can follow as long as they jump into a universe with a Spider person.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_03_INTRO_0,The Symbiotes were right. You couldn't help yourselves from chasing them.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_03_INTRO_1,Okay. They're making too many friends.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_03_END_0,This is odd. The portal distances are getting further apart.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_03_END_1,That doesn't sound good.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_03_END_2,It's not. We have to move fast.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_INTRO_0,Why is that portal so huge?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_INTRO_1,No idea.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_INTRO_2,The voice lent its power-
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_INTRO_3,IDIOT! DON'T TELL THEM!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_MID_0,We're out of here!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_END_0,HA! Miguel's gonna hate this.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_END_1,Dios mio. Hate what?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_END_2,We get to have a playdate.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_04_END_3,"Please, anyone but him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_0,"Listen, Peter, we really need your help right now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_1,There's no telling what havoc the Symbiotes can kick up if they're universe-hopping.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_2,Hm. MJ won't be back for another few hours.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_3,We might be burning daylight here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_4,"No, no. This is fine. We're fine."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_INTRO_5,"Mask on, kiddo. Secret adventure time!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_START_0,"See, I told you we'd pick up on their trail of destruction."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_END_0,"So, let me get this straight."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_END_1,The Symbiotes are being called off to who knows where by... a whisper?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_END_2,"It's more than that. Whatever that thing is, it can force them to obey."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_END_3,And there's no telling what will happen when the Symbiotes get there.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_05_END_4,IF the Symbiotes get there.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_INTRO_0,"You're gonna love this. That was sarcasm, by the way."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_INTRO_1,Mayday's getting a little worn out and we do NOT want a cranky baby on our hands.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_INTRO_2,"We can't stop, or the Symbiotes will get away."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_INTRO_3,"Not the best time, I know. But there it is."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_END_0,"*GASP* She's yawning. This is not a drill, people."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_END_1,"If we're going to keep kicking bad guy butt, we'll need to keep the noise down."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_END_2,Mayday can be a real... Handful when her nap is interrupted.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_END_3,"Don't worry, handsome. Think of me like a thief in the night."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_06_END_4,I'm so glad Mayday's gonna be asleep for this one.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_0,Zzzz...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_1,This is perfect! She's still out like a light.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_2,Go back home. We can't risk this mission on a missed nap.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_3,"Such hostility! If I remember correctly, you used my DNA to get powers."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_4,"That kind of makes me your dad, so..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_5,"Watch your tongue, Mister, or you'll get grounded."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_6,And we'll dish out the punishment.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_INTRO_7,"For the record, I did NOT call them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_END_0,I'm going on ahead.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_END_1,"Be safe! Don't stay out too late, and don't talk to strangers!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_07_END_2,"Ugh, they grow up so fast."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_0,Check out the roof of that building.\n\nIs that another portal?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_1,Looks like it! At least we know the Symbiotes' jumping point.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_2,THIS JUST IN...\n\nWEB-HEAD TAKES BABY ON A CRIME SPREE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_3,HE'S A MENACE TO NEW YORK... AND A BAD DAD?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_4,"Hey! Keep it down, tin-can! You're going to wake..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_5,WAAHHH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_INTRO_6,"The baby. Well, now you've done it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_START_0,You won't like Mayday when she's angry.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_END_0,"That's not a healthy outlet for frustration, but I'll let it slide this time."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_END_1,This universe hop will distract her.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_END_2,She's traveled through portals before.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_END_3,Not like this.\n\nWe're traversing the Web.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_08_END_4,This is new for both of us! I'll get a ton of pictures!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_START_0,Pav!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_START_1,"Whoa, what are you all doing here?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_START_2,I swear I'm not struggling as much as it looks.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_END_0,No Miles or Hobie?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_END_1,They were hurt. That's why we're here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_END_2,My bros? Hurt?! Say less!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_09_END_3,What do you need me to do?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_INTRO_0,Each jump is getting the Symbiotes closer to the source of their power.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_INTRO_1,We need to stop them before Void Knight has enough time to recharge.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_INTRO_2,No problem. I know all the ways around the traffic.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_START_0,Typical traffic jam.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_END_0,"See, Mayday, that's why we don't get physical to release our frustrations."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_END_1,Road rage. It gets the better of everyone.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_10_END_2,Come on. The Symbiotes are kicking up a hornet's nest behind them.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_11_START_0,"These guys? Yeah, this will be quick."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_11_MID_0,Clones. Why is it always more clones?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_INTRO_0,"Okay, enough running. I've been skipping cardio, and all this chasing is killing me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_INTRO_1,You're too late. No stoppin' us now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_INTRO_2,"Wait, that portal looks different."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_MID_0,Try tailin' us now! HAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_END_0,We have a problem.\n\nThere's no thread to follow.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_END_1,What do you mean? Is there really a universe out there without a Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_END_2,We'll need to find someone with the ability to trace their location.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_12_END_3,I know the kid for the job.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_0,EARTH-14512...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_1,"Long time no see, kiddo."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_2,GOSH! My FRIENDS!\n\nWhat brings the whole gang here?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_3,We need your help to track symbiotes.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_4,"Ooooh, cool! I confiscated a teleporter-tracker thing from the Sinister Six a while ago, but..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_5,But?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_INTRO_6,But sadly your hands are gonna be full for the moment!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_END_0,"Like I was saying, I already have tracking tech modded into SP//dr, but it needs to be tuned."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_END_1,Can you use this thing?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_END_2,Is that a Venom sample? ...Gross!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_13_END_3,"But yeah, that would be perfect."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_0,"By the way, what did you think of that series I sent you?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_1,"I was on the edge of my seat. A regular white knuckle read, I'm tellin' ya!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_2,Wait... You read a manga?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_3,What can I say? Mr. Shimada gets the nitty gritty of putting the pieces together.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_4,"There you are, you little brat!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_INTRO_5,Yikes!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_END_0,"Geez, kid, what did you do to get on her bad side?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_END_1,I may have redirected her powers to create a laser firework display over the city last night.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_END_2,"Please, tell me you recorded it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_END_3,"Tch, duh! Hee-hee!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_14_END_4,"More importantly, that gave SP//dr enough time to calibrate its tracker!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_0,That's exactly what I want to hear.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_1,You and your robot will be coming with me now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_2,You got another thing comin' if you think I'm lettin' you get the kid.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_3,"Believe me, I'd rather just have the bot, but she's necessary."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_4,My fists havin' a meet and greet with your face is necessary.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_5,I know dad rage. And that's dad rage.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_INTRO_6,Aww.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_END_0,Hahaha.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_END_1,"Still hungry for another knuckle sandwich, punk?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_END_2,I'm not the only one after that bot.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_15_END_3,We have multiple hostiles moving in!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_START_0,Bad children get punished.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_START_1,Spinning up this bad bot now!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_MID_0,Keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times! Here we go!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_MID_1,"Peni, are these flashing lights interior decor?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_MID_2,Stabilizer's busted! Hold on tight. Our landing is going to be rough!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_0,SOMEWHERE...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_1,"Ow, my back."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_2,Deadpool?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_3,Spidey! You're ALIVE!\n\nHEART EYES!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_4,"Bad news, everyone. SP//dr's upgrade is going to need replacement parts."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_5,"In the Wasteland, anything can be a replacement part if you try hard enough."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_6,"But I got my thumb on the pulse for good parts, ya dig?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_SPIDERSOCIETY_16_END_7,This is going to take longer than I thought... M.J. is SO gonna notice we're gone.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_0,THE X-MANSION...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_1,"Jean? It's the middle of the night, what are you doing in the Danger Room?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_2,"I couldn't sleep. A voice, in my head... I didn't recognize it, but it felt familiar."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_3,I learned a long time ago to take your instincts seriously. What was it saying?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_4,"I couldn't tell. But the more I tried to focus in on it, the blurrier it got. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_5,"But I felt like I was being pointed to our past. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_6,"So, that's why you're in the Danger Room. To relive the past. Smart. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_INTRO_7,"Danger Room! Bring up our first mission. When the X-Men first met Magneto. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_START_0,"THERE he is! I've FOUND him!! X-MEN, ATTACK!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_START_1,"Ahhh! NOW I see my antagonists! Five costumed youths! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_START_2,Surely all their powers put together can be no match for MINE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_END_0,Everything seemed so much simpler then. Just the five of us against the Brotherhood...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_END_1,"Simpler, but lonelier. Growing up in that orphanage, I never thought I'd be around so many people like me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_END_2,"The orphanage... Scott, how did the school find you? How did it find any of us?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_END_3,"What do you mean? The Institute... Cerebro... This brought us together to save humanity. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_01_END_4,All on its own.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_INTRO_0,As much as I tried to keep the X-Men focused on mutant affairs...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_INTRO_1,"The world's too small for that, Scott. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_INTRO_2,"I didn't realize that how big mutant problems would be, and how quickly they'd become global threats."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_START_0,"BEHOLD MY COMING, INFERIOR BEINGS. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_START_1,THE WEAK SHALL BE CULLED AND ALL SHALL KNEEL BEFORE YOUR NEW MASTER.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_START_2,EN SABAH NUR... YOUR APOCALYPSE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_0,"Apocalypse is sealed away... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_1,"Thanks to our combined mystic powers and expertise on mutation, we may have stopped him forever. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_2,"Thank you, X-Men."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_3,"There... Did you see that? Doctor Strange mentioned our expertise... But who did he mean? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_4,"Hank, maybe? Who knows what Strange is talking about half the time."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_02_END_5,I remember Bobby just being excited to make new friends. Even if they weren't all  friends for long...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_START_0,C'mon Cap... This is all over if you just sign the paper. Register. Let's go back to fighting bad guys.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_START_1,"Register, and then what? Who gets to say what happens to that information? To those heroes?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_START_2,"Mutants aren't registering just because of who we are. We can't take our powers off when we're done playing hero, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_START_3,"Okay, I'm not going to be lectured on morality by a man in 'transitions' lenses. We're bringing you in."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_END_0,The Civil War really felt like it was going to be the end of everything. I can't believe Tony and Steve got past it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_END_1,"That's because you, my love, hold a grudge like no one else. Just ask Logan..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_END_2,"Heh, what can I say? I have a long memory."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_03_END_3,"But a strong moral compass... Which we learned here, at the school... Hm..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_INTRO_0,"My fellow Mutants... I come to you now, no longer your enemy. But as your new leader."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_INTRO_1,"You think yer just gonna walk in and take over? No way, buckethead. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_INTRO_2,"Wait, this memory... This is from when Magneto became the new Headmaster. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_INTRO_3,"Something odd occurred to me. I wanted to see it again. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_INTRO_4,Any chance to see Wolverine get taught a lesson the hard way. I should have brought popcorn.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_START_0,"Ah, Magneto! You are a guest, ya? Let us give you an official X-Men welcome!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_START_1,"A guest? More... An instructor. And your first lesson begins NOW. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_END_0,"Fine work, children. We've had our differences in the past, but in this new role, I can serve all mutantkind. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_END_1,"Wait, he was the NEW Headmaster..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_END_2,"Don't you find it odd that, before Magneto, we never had a Headmaster?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_END_3,"You know, I never thought about it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_04_END_4,That's just the way it always was. Huh.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_INTRO_0,"You know, there were plenty of times Logan was in the right. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_INTRO_1,"Don't remind me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_INTRO_2,"Scott, honey, that's the whole point of what we're doing here. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_INTRO_3,"Then let's get it over with. Let's see the time Wolverine was in the right and I... I could not have been more wrong. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_INTRO_4,"The time the Avengers took on the X-Men... And I lost. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_START_0,"You've gone too far, Slim. Whatever you think you're doin', whatever you're tryin' to gain... The price was too high. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_START_1,"What I'm DOING?! I'm saving all of mutantkind, Wolverine. I'm using the Phoenix Force to let our people WIN."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_START_2,"You sanctimonious son of a... You don't sound like you. You sound like Magneto. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_START_3,And I got one way I deal with Magneto. RAAAARGH!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_END_0,"I always think five steps ahead. With these powers, this burden of responsibility... I have to."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_END_1,"But for a guy with one big eye, I lost sight of everything. I owe Wolverine for pulling me back."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_END_2,Pulling you back from what?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_END_3,From... From... I'm not sure...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_05_END_4,"What did you actually do, Scott? Why can't we remember?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_INTRO_0,"Someone, something... It's missing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_INTRO_1,"Maybe that's why this feels familiar. The whole world had to live with that missing feeling. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_INTRO_2,This feels smaller scale. This feels localized.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_INTRO_3,"But maybe we can learn something if we just take a look. Danger Room, let's see the battle we fought right after the..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_INTRO_4,SNAP!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_START_0,"Earth's heroes. Look at you. Beaten and bloody. You've lost half of everything. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_START_1,"I could leave you in balance, but if you insist... I will collect the rest. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_START_2,"Thanos... You talk too much. And that's coming from me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_START_3,"Avengers, get the Gauntlet, take him down! Get everyone back!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_END_0,"Tony put everything back. Everyone back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_END_1,"Psychics and heroes spent years repairing the world. I don't think this is related to the Snap. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_06_END_2,"Thanos mentioned balance, though... What if what you're feeling is things being OUT of balance? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_INTRO_0,"We were asking if this voice was someone missing, but what if it's TOO MANY thoughts. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_INTRO_1,"Our dimension is overrun by corrupted and duplicated people from other worlds. A lot of extra minds.  "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_INTRO_2,"It's been a long time since I was a scared student fighting to shut out voices. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_INTRO_3,"Jean, you are the most powerful telepath on earth. I know that. But no one knows what havoc the invasion caused."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_INTRO_4,"Let's see that day. The day Ultimus Invaded. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_START_0,"Nick Fury. You know, across different dimensions, I never get bored of ripping your one good eye from your head. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_START_1,"Surrender the Nexus. Or don't. Either way this will be fast. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_START_2,"Oh, do you think this is our first alien invasion? One more and we get a new ring on Saturn. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_START_3,S.T.R.I.K.E. force? ATTACK!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_0,"And after the Invasion, things only got crazier. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_1,You imprisoned a Kree Demi-God inside a dimension made of M'Kraan Crystal! That would mess with anyone's powers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_2,"I hope you're right, Scott. And trying to find that feeling, that voice... It's only gotten fainter."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_3,"Maybe it's nothing. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_4,"If it isn't? We'll handle it, together. All of us. The X-Men, united. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_5,FAR ACROSS THE ASTRAL PLANE...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_6,"Jean... Find me... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_7,Bring my family... My students...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH0_07_END_8,"To me, my X-Men..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_0,"""THE DOUBLE DEATHLOK"", THE DINGIEST DIVE BAR IN THE WASTELAND..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_1,"Wade, we need replacement parts for a giant Japanese robot... What exactly are we doing in a bar basement?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_2,"Why, looking for a member of our merry crew of course!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_3,"Wait, is that... a fighting pit?! You brought me to a cage fight while I'm carrying my daughter?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_4,"Hey, I'm here with my daughter too! She's having a blast."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_5,Please don't include me in this.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_6,"Oh! There's our friend now. The guy in the middle of the fighting pit!\nHey, buddy!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_INTRO_7,ROAAAAAR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_START_0,Is that a PANDA BEAR?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_START_1,And WHAT a panda bear!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_START_2,Meet Pandapool! This Mutant Protector draws attention to defends his team.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_START_3,"An integral member of the Mercs for Money team, he is extremely powerful in War."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_START_4,"When teamed up with his human counterpart, Pandapool can revive as long as Deadpool hasn't been defeated."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_WAVE2_0,RAWR!?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_WAVE2_1,"Well funny you ask, I ran into some spiders."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_WAVE2_2,GRRRRGNK?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_WAVE2_3,I'll explain later but for now... TO BATTLE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_0,"Okay, so your teammate is a spray-painted panda?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_1,"Spideys, meet Pandapool - the species that endangers YOU!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_2,So... Cute...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_3,RAWR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_4,"He says thank you! And he ALSO says his fur color is all-natural, baby!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_5,You can understand him!?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_6,"Oh yeah! A Deadpool can understand another Deadpool, all throughout the multiverse."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_7,I guess in all the multiverse SOMEONE has to understand you guys.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_8,"Okay, great, we have a big bear... How does this help us fix Sp//dr and get home?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_01_END_9,"The Wasteland is dangerous, we needed MUSCLE! And now that we've got him... ROAD TRIP!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_0,A WAREHOUSE JUST OUTSIDE NEW OSBORN CITY...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_1,Osborn has a whole town in this dimension?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_2,"Oh yeah, the groovy ghoulie owns most of the East Coast ever since Red Skull got SNIKT-ed by Wolvie."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_3,"But we need to get out of town quick and I figured you guys wanted to ride in STYLE, so I knew EXACTLY what to steal..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_4,"Oh my goodness, is that..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_INTRO_5,The SPIDER-MOBILE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_START_0,I'm so excited to drive the Spider-Mobile! Bet it can really cut through traffic!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_START_1,"Traffic, skyscrapers, you name it! And it's great for the beach. Now if you will EXCUSE me, time to get to hotwirin'..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_END_0,Did I hear you right when you said that a SPIDER-MAN stole from MY facility?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_END_1,"Security footage shows four different spider-themed individuals, breaking and stealing a vehicle."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_END_2,"FOUR?! Why, that's a regular INFESTATION."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_END_3,"Now get out of my office before I show you how I squashed the original spiders... I have EXTERMINATORS to call! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_02_END_4,HAHAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_0,"Come on, you've been behind the wheel for hours! Let me drive a bit!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_1,"Too bad, kid! You're on board the Deadpool Express, and if you check the bumper sticker you'll see I only ""Brake For Iso-8""."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_2,Come on! I promise to be real careful.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_3,RAWR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_4,Pandapool says he's got next! If you want to argue with him...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_5,"No, he said LOOK OUT!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_INTRO_6,CRASH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_START_0,Who dares crash into my caravan of electric vehicles?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_START_1,SPIDERS?! I thought Osborn was joking!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_START_2,Destroy them!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_END_0,I thought this was a world without heroes? There were a lot of familiar faces working for Electro.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_END_1,"Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention. Clones, baby! You spider-nerds love clones, right? I could be getting that wrong..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_END_2,"Yeah, that's DEFINITELY wrong. Where did S.H.I.E.L.D. get clones?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_END_3,Some nerd named Miles Warren? My pal Ben told me about him before... You know... Dead!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_03_END_4,"Ugh, the Jackal... No matter what universe it is, that guy's a huge pain. Let's keep moving."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_INTRO_0,RRNFF?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_INTRO_1,What's he saying?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_INTRO_2,If I know anything about bears... He's asking about food.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_INTRO_3,"No, he was actually pointing out that big storm of black and white energy coming towards us!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_INTRO_4,I am PRETTY sure it's nothing. I've never been wrong. Don't ask anyone to confirm that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_START_0,"Wilson. Step aside, we're on the hunt for spiders tonight, not you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_START_1,RAWR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_START_2,Yeah! What he said!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_END_0,"You know, I've never had a good experience with that guy. Wait... I just got his name."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_END_1,"Well, thanks again for protecting us."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_END_2,GRMPH.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_04_END_3,"He says, ""No problem, Petey! We protect our clients."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_0,"Okay, we just crossed into the Midwest. This is where things get REALLY dangerous. Did you know they put chili on SPAGETTI out here?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_1,"Luckily, I've got backup waiting... Red Leader to Claw Leader!\nWhat's your 20? Over!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_2,"Wilson, where the hell have you been?! I'm outside the meeting point, it's swarming with Osborn's pawns."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_3,Pawns are no problem! We'll be right there... Also say 'over' when you're done talking. Over!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_4,Get your ass down here! We're burning daylight and I'm not getting caught with my claws out here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_5,...I'm waiting.\nOVER.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_6,"SERIOUSLY, GET OVER HERE!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_INTRO_7,"You said 'over'! That counts!\nOn our way, Claw Leader!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_START_0,"This is Daken, aka Fang. His mutant power allows him to heal fast and hit hard adding to his stealth."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_START_1,Daken is useful in war and taking down enemies clouded with stealth when working with the Mercs for Money.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_START_2,Alongside being anti-stealth his ultimate attack can slow down an entire teams speed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_0,Finally! What took you?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_1,"Sorry about that, bossman! We're here now, with our cargo.\nSay hi, Cargo!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_2,"Uh, hi. Deadpool says you can help us get back to our home dimension. Do your claws open portals, or...?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_3,"Sorry, they just slice stuff. But if you need help hopping dimensions, my old man, Logan, can help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_4,"Wait, like... LOGAN Logan?!\nYour dad is Wolverine?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_5,"No, the Adamantium claws and healing factor are a coincidence. Yeesh, is everyone from your dimension this dense?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_05_END_6,"Hear that, May? That's called SARCASM and it's just for jerks like this guy with the bad haircut."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_0,"Last I heard, the old man was dug in outside Phoenix. So that's where we gotta go. There's only one problem..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_1,No childseat in the Spider-Buggy?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_2,...Our path goes right through Lizard territory.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_3,"Great, I've beaten the Lizard plenty of times! His tail pops right off -\nit's gross, you'll love it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_4,"Great, then it's just his army of Hulks that we'll have to deal with."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_5,RAAAWWR?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_6,That's right. YOU get to smash THEM.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_INTRO_7,"Wait, how do YOU understand him?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_END_0,HOURS LATER...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_END_1,"Well, I certainly hope Connors can regrow from this. How in the hell have they been beating so many of the Sinisters?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_END_2,"Your mistake, Osborn, was to let them come to us. As always, I shall be the hunter...\nAnd a hunter needs a pack."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_END_3,"I hate to admit it, Sergei... But you're right. Let's get the old gang back together."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_06_END_4,Let's see if they're ready for a whole lot more than SIX! HAHAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_0,"Ah, the famous West Texas Fog! Thick as barbecue sauce and a local sherriff's middle section!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_1,"I know I'm not from here, but there's no way that's a thing, right?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_2,"Yeah, this isn't normal. The fact that the fog is green should have been your first clue. Somethin's up."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_3,"Aw, man, I should have known.\nIf it's green fog, it's got to be..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_4,"MUH-HAHAHA! Welcome to my wasteland of illusions, fools!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_INTRO_5,I hate this guy.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_START_0,"Well, I wasn't able to get the jump on you like I did your father all those years ago! Too bad."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_START_1,"Yeah, he's the old model. Let me show you what the new one can do."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_END_0,The twerp ran away! What a coward.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_END_1,Yeah... He does that. It's annoying.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_END_2,ROOWR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_07_END_3,"That's true, the fog DID clear up!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_0,You know what? We're making record time. I apologize for doubting your driving skills.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_1,NNGHF.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_2,The bear... Is DRIVING! I need to get a picture!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_3,RAURGH.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_4,"Uh, is anyone else's Spider-Sense is going CRAZY right now?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_INTRO_5,I don't have one but I can see that buggy-tracking rocket headed our way! Everyone GET DOWN!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_START_0,Sound off! Is everyone okay?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_START_1,"We're unhurt, but Peni is trapped under wreckage! It will take time to get her out."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_START_2,"Enemies incoming. Webheads, focus on getting the kid out. We've got this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_END_0,How's the kid?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_END_1,"They got her out.\nAny more incoming, boss?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_END_2,Oh yeah. I can smell them coming. And I can't see a way out.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_END_3,"True. Unlike the fool in the fishbowl, you will not find MY trap so easy to escape."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_08_END_4,"Welcome, weaklings, to our\nSinister Surprise!\nAH-HAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_0,"Aw, Gobby! Even across dimensions, we found each other. I'm glad my wife isn't here, she'd be jealous!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_1,"I've always hated your jokes, Parker. But I have to admit, I'm excited to hear you choke on them...\nOne! Last! Time!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_2,"Sorry, Osborn. The spiders are getting safe passage, whether you like it or not."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_3,"The son of Wolverine, caring for strays? What happened, Daken?\nDid you get soft?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_4,GRRRRGNK!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_INTRO_5,"It's like the bear said -\nTHEY'RE CLIENTS! You're goin' down, Greenie!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_START_0,"I have many beasts above my mantle... But you shall be my finest prize. A rug, perhaps?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_START_1,ROOOAWR!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_START_2,"He says, ""BACK ATCHA PAL!"""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_0,"Satisfying as it is to slice and dice your goons, Osborn, we've got a job to finish. Get out of our way."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_1,RAWR!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_2,You idiots! I've spent years in a world where I SQUASHED every spider!\nI won!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_3,Do you REALLY think I'll let them REINFEST this world?\nI'll never stop! I'll destr-
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_4,SNIKT!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_5,ARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_6,"Pipe down, Osborn. Kids, today.\nToo damned noisy."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_7,Now... All of you punks that came with Osborn... Get off my lawn.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_MFM_09_END_8,"Hey, old man.\nWe could use your help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_0,"A WEAPON X FACILITY, DEEP IN THE CANADIAN WILDERNESS..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_1,"So this is the famous ""Weapon X"".\nCan't say I'm impressed."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_2,Should be simple work to find where they're keeping Wolverine and the others...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_3,"*SNIKT* Turn around nice and easy, bub."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_4,Wolverine? I was just about to bust you out. How did you get free?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_5,"I ain't yer Wolverine. But I'm here lookin' for answers, and he might have 'em."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_6,"Tsk, multiversal nonsense. Exhausting."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_INTRO_7,"I'll take the help, though. They have Wolverine in maximum security. Come on, it's just up ahead."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_START_0,There he is! We've got to get those machines off of him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_START_1,The IVs... the restraints...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_START_2,RRAAAHH!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_START_3,Whoa! Watch the claws!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_MID_0,"Logan? Meet, uh, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_0,Thanks. Don't know how much more of that I could take.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_1,No problem. Now maybe ya can lend me a hand.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_2,I need to know where Professor Xavier is.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_3,"Bub, never heard of him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_4,"You've forgotten Chuck too, huh? No one here remembers the man."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_5,"If there's one thing I can't stand, it's having my head messed with."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_6,I'll look into it - one of the brainiacs I was brought here with might.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_01_END_7,"Alright, find yer buddies. I'll get the rest of the captive mutants outta here."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_INTRO_0,"""Professor Xavier""? Another Wolverine? Does any of this make sense to you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_INTRO_1,"Not a word, but it's makin' my claws itch. If this guy's any help, we should figure it out."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_INTRO_2,AAHHH!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_INTRO_3,"Sounds like he's havin' fun, at least."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_INTRO_4,"True, but the stragglers are coming our way!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_START_0,"Oh, come on! Not you!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_START_1,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_0,"Ok, ok, I give up! I'll tell you everything I know, but I don't have high clearance."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_1,"My pay sucks, the hours are horrible. Don't even get me started on the ""benefits."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_2,"Start singin', birdie. Where's the group I was brought in with?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_3,All I know is that one is in the next sector. The others were taken further into the compound.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_4,Can I go now?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_02_END_5,"Not a chance, bub."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_INTRO_0,He better not have given us bad intel.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_INTRO_1,"No, we're close. It's faint, but I can smell 'em."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_START_0,More guards. Logan really kicked the hornet's nest!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_END_0,They're in one of these rooms.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_END_1,It looks like most of them were already evacuated.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_03_END_2,Seems like they forgot to tell these guys.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_INTRO_0,Radio for backup! Wolverine is loose!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_INTRO_1,*BZZT* We know! He's tearing through Medical!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_INTRO_2,There's TWO of them?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_START_0,I'm givin' ya one chance to make this easy and let our buddy there go.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_START_1,WHERE'S THAT BACKUP?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_START_2,Have it your way. *SNIKT*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_0,I'll cut ya loose.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_1,"Northstar? Wake up, buddy!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_2,Their data suggests they were trying to hypercharge his photokinesis.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_3,They woulda made him a walkin' nuke!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_4,Shhhh... I have a killer migraine and you both are SO loud.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_5,I ain't got time to baby ya. We gotta find the others.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_04_END_6,They're still trapped?! What are we standing around for then?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_0,Where are the others?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_1,All we know is that they're further in the facility.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_2,"That's hardly useful intel. Give me a minute, I'll find them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_3,Just because he has superspeed doesn't mean he has to be a super jerk.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_4,I thought you of all people would be able to take a little hit.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_5,Cool it. Did ya find 'em?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_INTRO_6,"I did. Guardian is nearby, but we have company incoming."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_START_0,"They've released Northstar! Sir, shouldn't we fall back?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_START_1,"You have your orders, soldier!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_END_0,"This place is a giant, constantly changing maze."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_END_1,What's worse is that some of the sectors are self-destructing.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_05_END_2,We'll need to move quickly if we want to find Guardian.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_0,I thought the Weapon X program went under.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_1,"Weapon X, Orchis, groups like these never stop."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_2,But why us? Not all of us are mutants.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_3,No clue. I was separated early when they brought us here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_4,"Honestly, let's just tear them apart and not ask. I'd rather not think about it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_INTRO_5,"Good news - you won't have to think about anything, ever again."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_START_0,Good timin'. I needa work off some frustrations.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_0,"Did any of the scientists say anything about you, Northstar?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_1,They said I'd be a catalyst. That I'd be the one to show the world how dangerous mutants are.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_2,It wouldn't be the first time they tried to make weapons out of us.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_3,*BOOM!!*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_4,That's not a good sound.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_5,"If the place is self-destructin', we're wastin' time standin' around."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_06_END_6,"Pick up the pace, you two - we need to move, NOW!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_0,I'm surprised this sector hasn't self-destructed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_1,I sabotaged some of the blast doors on my way back.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_2,"That'll keep some of the rooms from blowin', but these facilities have their own floodin' system."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_3,"If we don't find the others fast, we'll get caught underwater."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_4,CALL IT IN! THE INTRUDERS ARE HERE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_07_INTRO_5,We don't need this right now!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_INTRO_0,Here's the room they're keeping Guardian in!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_INTRO_1,"Of course, he's still surrounded and hooked up to that... thing."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_INTRO_2,That's not just any machine. I've seen this before... been IN it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_INTRO_3,Weapon X uses it to brainwash their experiments into obedience.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_INTRO_4,Sounds to me like this machine needs to be put out of commission.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_START_0,Protect the subject! We can't lose our progress!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_0,Guardian is still unresponsive.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_1,"I'm working on it, but these switches, dials, and buttons aren't exactly labeled for outsiders."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_2,"My claws got a message that'll come in loud an' clear. Move aside, bub!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_3,No! We don't know what consequences an abrupt interruption will--
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_4,*SLICE*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_5,"-cause. Too late, I guess."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_08_END_6,He's waking up! Be ready for anything.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_0,Where... Where am I?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_1,Some of my systems are offline. What's going on?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_2,We're in a Weapon X bunker goin' through its death throes.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_3,"They were poking around in your head, Jim."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_4,Do you remember anything?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_5,"Yes...\nWhen they dragged me in, someone else was being taken out... I think it was Walter."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_INTRO_6,We can't let Sasquatch's mind fall into Weapon X's hands.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_START_0,I should've known better than to leave that peabrain Octavius guarding you!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_START_1,"Tell us where our friend Sasquatch is, or face my wrath."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_0,I don't suppose we'll get much information out of him now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_1,That won't be a problem. I'll hack into their security system and check the remaining live feeds.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_2,Being a cyborg has its perks.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_3,Maybe that's why they put Sasquatch through that machine before me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_4,The mechanical side of my brain has firewalls that make mind manipulation difficult.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_09_END_5,Wait... I've located Sasquatch.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_INTRO_0,There's an R&D room housing new brainwashing technology up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_INTRO_1,They have Sasquatch working on getting into a working state.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_INTRO_2,Thinkin' about what they did to you and Northstar... Not sure I want to know what they're plannin'.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_INTRO_3,Good thing you'll never make it far enough to figure it out anyway.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_START_0,That room has the only escape route this far into the facility.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_10_START_1,"Even if you beat us, you'll be overrun! HAHAHA!!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_11_START_0,Red Goblin wasn't kidding about the number of guards coming this way.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_11_END_0,We're made it! And it looks like we're just in time for the big brawl.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_11_END_1,Is that?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_11_END_2,"Yeah, it's me. Kind of. It's a long story."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_11_END_3,He's fighting Sasquatch - we can't let them kill each other.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_START_0,STOP! Sasquatch is being controlled.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_START_1,Then it sounds like I need to knock a wake-up call into his fuzzy head!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_0,"Easy, he's with us."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_1,Didn't look that way to me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_2,We know better than most what it's like to have someone scramble our brains.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_3,He's still with us.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_4,"Either way, no one's heard of one of the most important mutants in history."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_12_END_5,This machine and that overgrown furball are my tickets to finding out why.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_INTRO_0,Sasquatch? Are you with us? What do you remember?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_INTRO_1,"Everything. I wasn't in control, but I could see it all... This machine must be destroyed!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_INTRO_2,"Not so fast, bub. I need to see why I'm the only one that knows about Xavier."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_INTRO_3,"Of course. As a show of gratitude for freeing me, even as violently as you did, let me help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_INTRO_4,"Strap in, and I'll get you an answer."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_START_0,Keep these interlopers off our backs. These results are fascinating.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_0,"So, what's the damage, Doc?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_1,"None whatsoever. Your memories haven't been altered, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_2,"Maybe this guy doesn't exist on our world. You're from another dimension, bub."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_3,Then who formed the X-Men? Why ain't Apocalypse or Magneto running the planet?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_4,I... Ugh... I can't remember. Wait a sec... You gotta hook ME up.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_5,Are you sure?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_13_END_6,Something's up. And if this Xavier guy is so important to you... He's probably important to me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_0,What's this thing do anyway?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_1,It's meant to alter memories. Key events in our growth shape how we use our powers.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_2,This would give Weapon X's benefactors the power to pick and choose which memories to give someone.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_3,Some memories aren't meant for others to have.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_4,Precisely why this machine needs to be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_5,"Wolverine, are you ready?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_INTRO_6,Get to it already.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_START_0,"Out of the way, peons! Let me show you how a REAL Osborn handles these gnats."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_START_1,"If we're interrupted now, we won't get answers! We must stop them!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_MID_0,The device is almost there.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_0,"Rrrrr... Hurry it up, I feel like I'm gonna hurl."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_1,Done! Fascinating...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_2,What did you find out?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_3,"Using your mind as a map to the memories of your Professor, I found interesting gaps."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_4,"It's strange... Rather than new, altered memories, it's as if there's a dense fog over old ones."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_5,"Well, ain't that just grand."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_14_END_6,"Guardian, radio Fury. We're going to need a lift, and more research."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_15_INTRO_0,I established a connection with S.T.R.I.K.E. - Fury's on his way.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_15_INTRO_1,"Good. If I never see another Weapon X facility, it'll be too soon."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_15_INTRO_2,"Never say never, Wolverine. Any time traveller can tell you that. I won't let you all get away so easily."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_0,"Good work in shutting down this facility, gentlemen."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_1,"Fury, I assume ya know what's goin' on?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_2,"Dr. Langkowski over there gave me a sit rep, though I don't have answers for you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_3,"Someone's messin' with our heads, Fury. I need answers."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_4,That's why I brought one of the smartest people I know.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ALPHAFLIGHT_16_END_5,"Hello, little angry men. I heard you could use a hand in finding your friend."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_0,"AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, DEEP WITHIN THE JUNGLES OF WAKANDA..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_1,Let me get this straight. You eggheads get together and what... Make secret plans for the world?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_2,"Alone, we stopped crises as they arose. Together we can actively guide the world towards betterment."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_3,"Hm, where've I heard that before? So, what makes you think Professor Xavier was a part of this?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_4,"Well, each of us represent a different group of heroes. Yet, we don't have a mutant representitve."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_5,"If this Charles Xavier was who you say, he'd be the perfect representative for your people."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_6,"It's the negative space. If he'd never existed, someone else would represent mutants. Instead... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_7,"There's nobody, which means there musta been somebody. You guys have got brains, I'll give ya that."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_8,ALERT! PERIMETER BREACH! PERIMETER BREACH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_INTRO_9,"It appears we will have to continue this conversation later! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_START_0,"Meet Black Panther (Shuri), The Illuminati's Controller."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_START_1,"She assists allies and stops enemies from gaining speed, and is an integral member of the team in Cosmic Crucible."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_START_2,"A powerful combatant, Black Panther stops enemies from having full access to their abilities."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_WAVE1_0,They just keep comin'. Thought this was supposed to be a secure location?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_WAVE1_1,"Do you want to help resecure it, or continue to complain? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_WAVE1_2,"Yes, ma'am."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_0,"Doctor Pym, Logan and I are moving to check the rest of the perimeter. I doubt those invaders were alone."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_1,"Make it quick. Comms are blocked, so we couldn't call for backup even if we wanted to. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_2,"Your bedside manner needs work, Henry. But we will report back shortly."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_3,Is this how you recruit poor saps? Promise answers and enlist them in a fight?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_4,"We're grateful for your help, Logan. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_5,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_01_END_6,I think Black Bolt says 'thank you' as well.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_0,"The building appears secure, for now. But this felt less like an invasion and more like..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_1,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_2,"A scouting party! Dr. Pym, Dr. Richards, we have new arrivals!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_3,We're entering the facility now. I'll let you know when we get access to their security system.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_4,Taskmaster. You have chosen the wrong enemies today. Why are you attacking us?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_INTRO_5,Cause that's how I get paid.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_END_0,"Taskmaster escaped, but I managed to acquire one of his communication devices."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_END_1,Perfect. I assume you're hacking it to locate him?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_END_2,"I already have. Though I am troubled by how sophisticated the technology is. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_END_3,He seemed equipped far better than normal. Someone's helping him. Who even knows we're here?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_02_END_4,"That is not the question that troubles me, Dr. Richards. That question is... Who is smart enough to find us?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_03_INTRO_0,"I have hijacked their radio - if we acquire more, we can boost the signal and track them to their origin."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_03_INTRO_1,Time to go on the offensive.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_03_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_03_INTRO_3,"Black Bolt says, ""After you."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_INTRO_0,"We have located their base. Certaintly, the leader of this assault lies within."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_INTRO_1,And perhaps their technology can help determine how they found us to begin with.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_INTRO_2,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_INTRO_3,"You are right, Black Bolt - the time to strike is now! Attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_START_0,INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_START_1,"Well, well, well. Nice of you to drop by, 'cuz. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_START_2,Killmonger. Of course you are here. Defend yourself!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_END_0,"You are a mercenary, not a mastermind. Tell me who hired you to find us!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_END_1,"No can do, cuz. It was a blind hire, so I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. Which I don't."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_END_2,"Maybe your technology knows more than you do, Killmonger. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_END_3,"I've gained access to their system, but I need Hank. I'll patch him in and see what he can find."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_04_END_4,Do it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_INTRO_0,"Tik-tock, Shuri. Better hurry up with that tech check..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_INTRO_1,"What have you done? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_INTRO_2,"Tsk, y'all supposed to be the smart ones, too. If someone could afford me, they can afford backup."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_INTRO_3,"Reed, Dr. Pym, we have incoming!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_INTRO_4,"I've just connected to their system! Keep them out until I've got the answers we need. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_0,"That's the last of them. Hank, what did you find? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_1,"Decrypting the last transmission now. When I find out who did this, I'll make sure they... Oh. Oh NO."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_2,What? What have you discovered?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_3,"HELLO, FATHER."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_4,"It's Ultron! And... My god, connecting to his systems, it's a two way street... He's got full access to our files."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_SHURI_05_END_5,"We have played right into his hands. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_0,"Ultron, back again... Outsmarting me... This is like a nightmare. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_1,What did he get?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_2,"Impossible to tell. I locked him out for now, but it's only a matter of time before he gets back in."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_3,What do we do in the meantime?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_4,We can't risk another trace. Who knows what damage Ultron has done already.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_INTRO_5,"Then we find more of these mercenaries and get the info from them. The hard way. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_START_0,"Meet Hank Pym, the Illuminati team's Support."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_START_1,Hank heals his allies and provides them a Barrier. He's an integral member of the team within Cosmic Crucible.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_START_2,"Alongside any two Illuminati members, Hank blocks enemy regeneration and prevents Slow on his allies. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_END_0,"I got some info off of Ultron's hired goons before they lost consciousness. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_END_1,"Dr. Pym, Hank... You need to take a breath. I understand Ultron brings up some bad memories…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_END_2,"Bad memories?! Did you create an artificial intelligence that constantly threatens the world, Reed?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_END_3,"Ultron is my responsibility, and every microsecond he's online, he's scheming. I don't have time to breathe. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_01_END_4,Then we'll have to make time.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_0,"Uh, bad news science bros. Long range sensors have picked up another wave of robo-goons."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_1,Another direct attack... That's not like Ultron. He's too smart. Something's off.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_2,"Do we think it has anything to do with our short, smelly, multiversal pal showing up?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_3,"Smelly? I got super senses, Stark. When's the last time you washed that suit?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_4,"Anything could be related. Or not. Ultron's playing Nth dimensional chess. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_02_INTRO_5,For now we just need to move our pieces and hope we see his plan.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_0,"These attacks... They're a distraction. Finally, some good news."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_1,What do you mean?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_2,"Ultron's brilliant but single-minded. He wants one thing - world domination and humanity's extinction. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_3,"If his plans were inevitable, he wouldn't bother with us - he'd destroy us with the rest of the world."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_4,"Hank, you're even worse at ""some good news"" than Reed is. What are you saying?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_INTRO_5,"I'm saying that for some reason, Ultron doesn't want us to interfere. He's scared. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_END_0,If Ultron keeps sending bots I'm going to have to buy a junkyard in Wakanda just to store these things.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_END_1,Damn! We're the smartest people on Earth. If we just had a moment to think...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_END_2,"Unfortunately, this base is too valuable. Who knows what damage our enemies could do with our data."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_03_END_3,"Wait... Maybe that's what Ultron's counting on. So, we do something he never would expect."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_0,"Tony, are the charges planted?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_1,"Repulsor mines all over the place. You sure about this? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_2,"Ultron's playing chess with us? Well, I'm willing to to sacrifice a valuable piece to win."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_3,"If he's keeping us distracted defending our base... No more base, no more distraction."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_4,EXPLOSIVES DETECTED! DISARM! DESTROY!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_INTRO_5,"Of course, we need to actually detonate the base for this to work. Take out the drones, now!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_0,"Reed! Did the remaining drones get to the sub-basement? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_1,Sensors are showing they've gathered right where we herded them. No way out.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_2,"Then it's now or never. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_3,ELIMINATE THE CREATOR! DESTROY! DESTR-
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_4,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_5,So much for our fancy clubhouse...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_04_END_6,"You'll buy us a new one. Now, it's time to find Ultron."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_INTRO_0,"Without a target, Ultron's drones are scrambling like hornets that've had their nest kicked. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_INTRO_1,Perfect. I've got an algorithm that can analyze their flight patterns and lead us right to him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_INTRO_2,"Did the algorithm detect the ones headed right towards our Quinjet landing pad? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_INTRO_3,The last stragglers! We take them out and we can go after the source.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_0,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_1,"Well, there goes another Quinjet."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_2,"Hello, friends! Do you need a lift?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_3,"Perfect timing, Shuri. Glad to see your team made it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_4,You as well! Things will be much easier with us together.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_5,"Except for all of us crammed in here. Stark ain't exactly small in that armor, neither."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_6,"Tony, do you mind flying alongside? You can keep an eye out for extra drones."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_HANK_05_END_7,"And I was about to call shotgun, too."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_0,THE ARCTIC CIRCLE...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_1,"Sentries guard every entrance. I will give Ultron credit, he is thorough."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_2,"Okay, so the direct approach is out. How do we get in without having to fight every drone in this base?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_3,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_4,What'd big mouth over there say?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_INTRO_5,"He said, ""We can make our own entrance."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_END_0,We're in. Black Bolt wasn't subtle - Ultron definitely knows we're inside.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_END_1,"I might not be an egghead like all of you, but am I the only one thinking this is a trap?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_END_2,"Anything could be a trap, Logan. There are multiple levels of thought at play."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_END_3,Does Ultron think that we think that he thinks it's a trap? And so on. It'll give you a headache.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_01_END_4,He can process infinite levels of that. So we act on the base level - attack and see what happens.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_0,"Another door with a multi-phasal combination lock. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_1,"Sophisticated, but with our combined calculations we should be able to open it in 8.27 minutes. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_2,"Or I could use these six universal lockpicks I got right here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_3,SLICE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_5,"I take it that was a 'nice work, Logan'?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_INTRO_6,"Please, Black Bolt... Don't encourage the Canadian. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_0,"Shuri, come in. We've reached another sub-basem- *EEEEEEEEE!*"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_1,Ahhh! Something's wrong with our comms!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_2,"GREETINGS, FATHER. YOU'VE COME FURTHER THAN I ANTICIPATED. I'LL HAVE TO UPDATE MY DATA ON YOU. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_3,"So, there's something even the great A.I. doesn't know. Encouraging. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_4,"YOUR SUCCESS IS A ROUNDING ERROR. SOON, I WILL BE RID OF HUMANITY. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_5,"Stop being cryptic with me, I didn't program you to be a coward. What's your scheme?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_02_END_6,"DON'T WORRY. YOU WILL LIVE TO SEE MY TRIUMPH, FATHER. BUT NOT FOR VERY LONG. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_INTRO_0,What are we waiting for?! Let's get a move on!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_INTRO_1,"Woof, hey! Hank! Take a beat."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_INTRO_2,"You take a beat, Tony! I founded the Avengers, I invented a new particle, but what's my legacy going to be?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_INTRO_3,"THIS! Creating a murderous robot that may end the world! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_INTRO_4,"Gentlemen, if you could table this argument for the moment, we are still under attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_0,"Hey, you don't need to tell me about the founding of the Avengers. I was there, remember?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_1,"I mean, I was in a 2-ton gold suit, kind of hard to forget me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_2,"Do you have a point, Tony?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_3,"Yeah, time for some real talk. Ultron isn't your cross to bear, Hank. It's your temper."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_4,"Every decision driven by anger and ego is one more mistake that Ultron can use against us. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_5,"You've got to keep it in check. And trust me, I know about inner demons."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_03_END_6,"You're right, Tony. I'm a genius. Time to start thinking like one."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_0,"Good news. The mainframe of this base uses Ultron tech, which gives him near total control. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_1,"Gotta be honest, none of what you said sounds good to me. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_2,"I INVENTED Ultron tech. I hacked in and located where he's transmitting data to. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_3,"Then let's go there? Like, now?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_4,"Could be a trick. Tony, you're the fastest here - I'll upload coordinates to J.A.R.V.I.S. Scout it out."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_5,So we split up?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_INTRO_6,"OH, I'll make sure you're split up alright! Into as many pieces as it takes! HAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_START_0,"Still want me to take off? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_START_1,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_START_2,"Cheers, Iron Man. I believe I can handle these cads. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_0,"Welcome to the fight, Brian. Annoyingly perfect timing, as usual. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_1,"Would have been here faster, but Ultron had unleashed an attack on England as well."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_2,"No disrespect, Captain, but that seems like an odd target. Why England?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_3,"Could be to keep me busy? It seems he knows quite a bit of our little club, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_4,"Yes, and that carelessness with our secrets has cost us a base. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_04_END_5,"There will be time for blame later. For now, we press on."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_0,"Iron Man, any news from those coordinates? We could use a sit rep."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_1,"En route now, but my sensors are detecting something big. And absolutely bursting with power."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_2,"I take it that it's rather bad, then?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_3,"There's that dry British sense of humor. Say, I've been meaning to ask - what's Benny Hill really like?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_4,"Wait, I have visual on the site... It's... Oh my god. Ultron's buil--- *SKKKKKTT!*"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_INTRO_5,"Tony? Tony, what is it, come in?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_START_0,Iron Man's been cut off! We need to get to him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_START_1,"We can attend to him shortly! For now, we must defend ourselves!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_END_0,"Iron Man, come in! Tony, are you there?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_END_1,"I HAVE CUT THE STRINGS OF YOUR LITTLE METAL PUPPET, FATHER. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_END_2,"HE FOUND MY LOCATION, BUT YOU CANNOT STOP MY DESIGNS. AFTER ALL... THEY ARE YOUR OWN."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_END_3,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_TEAM_05_END_4,"COME AND SEE, CREATOR. COME AND SEE. HA. HA. HA. HA."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_0,"THE QUINJET, EN ROUTE TO ULTRON'S BASE..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_1,"Ten minutes out from Iron Man's last known location. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_2,"What did Ultron mean, about these plans being ours?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_3,It could be anything. Perhaps just a lie to confuse us?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_4,"Ultron is spiteful but he isn't a liar. If he's getting inside our heads, he'd use a kernel of truth to do it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_5,"I don't care what he's sayin', get me within claw sharpening range and I'll shut him up. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_INTRO_6,"You may get to do it sooner than expected - drones en route. I'm landing this bird. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_START_0,"Meet Captain Britain, the Illuminati team's Protector."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_START_1,"The team's heavy hitter, he's an integral part of their success in Cosmic Crucible."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_START_2,Captain Britain helps keep his team immune to negative status effects and stops enemies from manipulating his ally's speed bar.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_END_0,"That's as far as this old girl's going to get us, I'm afraid. I can fly, but as for the rest of you..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_END_1,"You try and carry me and I'm gonna reenact the War of 1812. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_END_2,Logan that is... a particularly surprising reference.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_END_3,"Just because I don't go around calling myself Mr. Fantastic doesn't mean I can't pick up a book. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_01_END_4,"C'mon, we're wasting time. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_INTRO_0,"There! A crater up ahead. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_INTRO_1,"Repulsor burns. This must have been where Tony went down. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_INTRO_2,"Iron Man, come in! Can you read us?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_INTRO_3,"IRON MAN IS NO MORE. SOON, YOU WILL JOIN HIM. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_0,There's too many drones! We're getting overwhelmed.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_1,ZZAT!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_2,A few repulsor blasts should help even the odds.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_3,"Tony! Thank god, how'd you survive?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_4,"Ultron hacked the suit once I got too close. I bailed out, but when he detonated it, he thought I was in it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_5,"I could call in a backup suit, but you know what? Still PRETTY rude. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_6,"Your transmission cut out. What did you find just before you went down? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_7,"It's bad. The designs he's using to end the world? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_02_END_8,"They're ours. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_0,"StarkTech, Vibranium, Unstable Molecules, Pym Particles... Even your interdimensional energy, Cap."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_1,"Ultron saw us combine forces to take on the world and I guess thought, ""Hey! Good idea."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_2,"That's what he built here. A machine to end the world, using the Illuminati as a blueprint."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_3,"Good god... Okay, so what do we do about this?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_4,"Isn't it obvious? No one knows the tech better than us. We're the only ones here. And, we're heroes."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_INTRO_5,We stop him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_END_0,This base... It's not just a facility for him to build his doomsday device. It IS the device.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_END_1,"CORRECT. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_END_2,"You made a crucial mistake taking us on, Ultron. We invented this tech, we can disarm it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_END_3,"INCORRECT. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_03_END_4,"I AM ALSO YOUR INVENTION, FATHER. AND YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FULLY DEFEAT ME. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_0,This place is drawing a frankly impressive amount of power. When it gathers enough...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_1,It's all over. How do we stop it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_2,"Vibranium's specific frequency CAN be disrupted, but we need power and a way to channel it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_3,"If it's power you need, I have that in spades."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_4,"Of course! Brian, if we patch you into Tony's suit…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_5,The repulsor tech should be able to negate the vibranium engine Ultron built and shut this thing down!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_6,"Great call. Big Brains 1, murderous robots 0. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_7,"YOU HAVE NOT WON YET! MY DRONES HAVE DELAYED YOU LONG ENOUGH. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_INTRO_8,"NOW, I WILL DESTROY YOU MYSELF!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_START_0,"We've got Ultron! Tony, get Britain's powers hooked up, now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_START_1,"Well, since you asked SO nicely, Hank. Just buy me time."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_0,Done! Captain Britain's powers are hooked into my repulsor array.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_1," Suddenly I'm craving a few centuries of imperialism and a nice cup of tea."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_2,HALT. HALT!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_3,"I can hold this metal cad, but only for so long! Whatever you need to do, Iron Man, do it now!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_4,Pressing the button and thinking of England!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_04_END_5,RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_INTRO_0,"Vibrainum engine neutralized... We have destroyed your engine of death, android. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_INTRO_1,"YOU HAVE DESTROYED NOTHING. ONLY DELAYED ME. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_INTRO_2,THE VIBRANIUM WOULD ALLOW MY MACHINE TO WIPE OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_INTRO_3,THE ENGINE INSTEAD WILL SIMPLY WIPE OUT ALL LIFE... IN THIS BASE!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_0,HKKZT... THIS IS NOT DEFEAT... I WILL RECALIBATE. REFORM. RETURN.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_1,He's right. He's a danger to everyone on Earth. Unless he's not on Earth.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_2,"Hank, what are you doing? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_3,"He's gathered our tech to end us? I'm going use it to end him. I'm flinging Ultron across the universe. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_4,And where's he gonna end up? You're dropping a damn bomb on some other civilization!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_5,"The universe is huge. The odds he lands anywhere inhabited are infinitesimally small. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_6,"He's right. The math works, and we have to think of humanity first."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_7,FATHER... FATHER!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_8,"So long, Ultron. I will not miss you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_9,"You smug sons a... Playing god, making decisions in the shadows..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ILLUMINATI_CB_05_END_10,Yer no better than the damned robot. Wherever Xavier is... I'm glad he ain't here for this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_0,"Sir, do you have everything packed? I can run down the checklist again if you need."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_1,"Hill, this S.T.R.I.K.E. summit is two days in another universe.\nWe'll be fine."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_2,We're going to meet with Fury's and Hills from across the multiverse! I want to make sure it goes smoothly.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_3,"I appreciate your zeal, Hill. But it's two days away, what's the worst that could happen?\nCome on, let's roll. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_5,...is he gone?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_6,"HE'S GONE! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_INTRO_7,PARTY TIME!!!\n\nEVERYONE INTO THE POOL!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_0,Welcome to Deadpool's Interdimensional Pool Party here on the world famous S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_1,"They said ""Deadpool, you shouldn't install an Olympic-sized swimming pool on a floating fortress!"" "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_2,But you know what I said?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_3,CANNONBALL!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_4,Hey Wade... Got room in the water for your ol' pal Toad?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_START_5,GASP! PARTY CRASHERS!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_END_0,"Jeeze... A simple ""No"" would have sufficed. Come on, Blob, we'll go swim where we're welcome! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_END_1,New Jersey!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_END_2,"Hm, it didn't occur to me when I kicked out the party crashes that they were the only people here... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_END_3,I've gotta kick start this shindig! And I know EXACTLY who can get this party going.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_01_END_4,Oh Loooooooooooogaaaaaaaaan....
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_0,"Okay, Wade, I'm here... What's the big emergency?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_1,Wolverine... Logan... Come closer... Help... I'm sick...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_2,"What's wrong? Did Sinister do this? Is it the Legacy Virus? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_3,No... It's worse...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_4,"I have POOL PARTY FEVER, and the only CURE is PUSHING YOU IN!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_5,*SPLASH*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_INTRO_6,"Well, bub, it's too bad you weren't dyin', because I'm gonna kill ya!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_START_0,"Let's calm down, short wet and hairy! What's the big deal? Adamantium doesn't rust!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_START_1,My outfit's SOAKIN' WET!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_START_2,"My message said ""suit optional""!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_MID_0,"Hey, a brawl! Now this party can really start!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_MID_1,EVERYBODY PILE ON WADE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_MID_2,Did you ONLY invite other Wolverines?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_MID_3,I wasn't sure any of you would show up! Help!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_END_0,So... So many claws... You've cut off pieces of me I didn't even know I had...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_END_1,"Heh, you know what Wade? This is actually my kinda party. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_END_2,"I told you! Now lose the spandex and hop back in the pool before the body hair from all these Logans clogs the filter. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_02_END_3,I love the smell of chlorine and jet fuel in the morning! Smells like SUMMER TIME!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_INTRO_0,Deadpool! What do you think you're doing up here?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_INTRO_1,Gasp! Vice Principal Coulson!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_INTRO_2,"Just some good old fashioned summertime shenanigans, sir! Completely Nick Fury approved. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_INTRO_3,"Yeah, there's no way that's true. I'm shutting this whole party down."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_START_0,"Come on, Phil! Live a little! Take a vacation!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_START_1,I know for a fact that the game devs making Marvel Strike Force haven't been in the office since May!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_START_2,"(Sorry, it's been a little while since I broke the fourth wall. I was getting itchy.)"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_0,"Okay, Wade... Pack up your floaties. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_1,"You know, you're being a real Scrooge right now. Or whatever his 4th of July equivalent is.\nThe Red Skull?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_2,"Sir, we've received a report that Apocalypse has resurfaced - he's attacking Paris."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_3,"We've got to handle this. Wade...\nThis had better be cleaned up when we get back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_4,"Aw man... Guess I better cancel the party and go ""save the world"". "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_5,Don't bother.\n\nApocalypse ain't doin' nothing.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_6,WOLVERINE!\nDid you call in a false tip? For little old ME?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_7,"Don't let it go to your head. Besides, we got bigger problems. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_03_END_8,We're outta drinks.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_INTRO_0,How?! An ice cold beverage in a little Deadpool (TM) Coozy is a crucial element of summer fun!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_INTRO_1,"There's a buncha Wolverines, Thing and Hulk are playin' flip-cup with giant barrels, and Thor's been tellin' stories. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_INTRO_2,"You put the thirstiest heroes in Nexus Earth on one place, whadda ya think was gonna happen?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_INTRO_3,"This is on me for knowing too many party animals. I see that now. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_INTRO_4,Luckily... I have a solution!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_START_0,"Mockingbird to Helicarrier Bridge! We're losing altitude fast, what is happening up there?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_START_1,"Ooooh, so THAT'S what that button does! Sorry, I'm trying to get this party bus moving. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_START_2,You're going to get us all killed! We need to put a stop to this now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_0,"Okay, let's really open this ol' gal up, see what she can do!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_1,EVERYONE HOLD ON!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_2,OR DON'T! YOUR CALL!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_3,*CRASH*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_4,Wade... What the hell... Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_5,"If we can't get drinks to the Helicarrier, time to go somewhere the buffets are endless and the tourists are sunburnt!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_01_04_END_6,WELCOME TO SUNNY ACAPULCO!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_INTRO_0,"You crashed the Helicarrier in Acapulco?! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_INTRO_1,Sure! It's a magical place!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_INTRO_2,You're thinking of Tahiti...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_INTRO_3,"Whatever! The important thing is that this beach resort we crashed on? It's All-Inclusive! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_INTRO_4,"Hit the buffet and order another frozen bev, bud!\nThis one's on Papa Scopely. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_START_0,Now to just bust out the ol' S.T.R.I.K.E. Black card...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_START_1,"I'm so sorry, sir. I'm afraid your card has been declined. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_START_2,"Hm, must be that ""gold shortage"" I'm always reading about on Reddit..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_START_3,Hey! It's the guy who crashed that thing and ruined our vacation! Get him!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_END_0,"Sir, I am SO sorry for the mix-up! You and your, ahem... Guests... Will get the gold star treatment. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_END_1,"Please, enjoy your stay."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_END_2,"Wow, Deadpool, I'm impressed. How'd you find the money for this?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_END_3,"I got desperate and told them I was Doctor Doom. Without our masks the resemblance is uncanny. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_01_END_4,Everyone... Hit the beach!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_0,"Okay, time for Deadpool's world famous volleyball tournament! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_1,"Everyone split up into teams, pick shirts and skins! Hulks... You don't have shirts, you're on skins."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_2,"Wade, take shirts."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_3,But I was hoping to get a tan!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_4,"This is a public beach.\nPeople are trying to eat. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_INTRO_5,"Hurtful... But fair. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_START_0,This is just like my favorite sexy scene from my favorite 80's action movie!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_START_1,"I'm just like ""Goose"" and ""Iceman""."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_START_2,Excuse me?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_START_3,Uh... Never mind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_0,"The beach, heroes, volleyball... This is just like my favorite issue of the Marvel Swimsuit Special!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_1,(They really should bring those back...)
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_2,"Hey, why'd everyone stop playing?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_3,Logan spiked the ball.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_4,Was it the winning point?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_5,"No, he SPIKED the ball.\nWith his claws. It popped."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_02_END_6,What?! NO! WILSON!!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_INTRO_0,"Hey, Deadpool? You're in charge of this party, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_INTRO_1,"Wow, I've never been in charge of anything. But yes, I am. At last."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_INTRO_2,"Here in Acapulco, Deadpool is gone. Refer to me instead as El Piscina Grande."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_INTRO_3,"Uh, sure... Either way, the snack cart is kind of infested?\nWith bees and ants?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_INTRO_4,El Piscina Grande is on the case\nTO THE SNACK CART!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_START_0,Hey! Shouldn't you be ruining a tee-ball game somewhere?! Buzz off!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_START_1,I am here for your empty zzzoda canzzz... And other zzznacks!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_03_START_2,"Yeesh, I knew this game was full of bugs, but this is ridiculous!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_INTRO_0,"Snack cart pests exterminated! Another summertime victory for me, Deadpool!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_INTRO_1,"What happened to ""El Piscina Grande""?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_INTRO_2,"I'm sorry, I don't know what that means. Who wants nachos?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_INTRO_3,WE DO!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_START_0,"When I said the buffet was all you can eat, that didn't include me!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_START_1,Wouldn't you rather eat the Thing? I hear he's milk chocolate under the hard candy coating.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_START_2,WE'LL MAKE DUE...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_0,"Okay, if katanas and mutant powers won't stop you... Time to try some sonic waves. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_1,"That's right, I'm talking\nRESORT KARAOKE!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_2,"HIT THE DISCO BALL, DAZZLER!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_3,NO... AAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_4,"WHEN YOU CALL MY NAME, IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PRAYER..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_5,RAAARGH! WE MUST FLEE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_02_04_END_6,Come back! And I was JUST about to do Tiny Dancer...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_0,Here's that sunblock you asked for. It's about one billion SPF.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_1,"Ah, the Lizard sunning himself on a rock, Ghost Rider manning the grill, and the Silver Surfer catching some waves..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_2,This pool slash beach party is an official SUMMERTIME SUCCESS.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_3,Where is he? Where's Deadpool?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_4,EEP! Coulson found us! Time for a quick costume change....
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_5,Deadpool! Stop right there!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_INTRO_6,"Me? No, no, no. My llama es\n""El Piscano Gigante"". "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_START_0,"Come on, you don't really expect me to fall for a costume change and a bad accent, do you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_01_START_1,Mi accent es muey bueno! Pase un semestre en Espana!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_INTRO_0,"Where'd he escape to?! Come on, down this street, right through..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_INTRO_1,A parade?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_INTRO_2,"Sir, isn't that him on that float?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_INTRO_3,We've got him! And he's... Singing?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_INTRO_4,"Danke schoen, darling danke schooooeen..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_START_0,"Agents, take him down!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_START_1,"Honestly, it's good you stopped me, we could NOT afford the rights to the next song."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_0,"Okay, Coulson... You got me... Send me to summer school, give me detention, shut down the rec center..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_1,"Oh, come on... I don't WANT to be a buzzkill. It's my job. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_2,"Who's going to know? Fury's on the other side of the multiverse... Let what little hair you've got left down. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_3,Besides... We were about to make you Carnival King of the Parade...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_4,Really?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_5,Sure! It's definitely not something I JUST made up.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_02_END_6,"Now bust out whatever embarrassing dad swimsuit you have, and let's catch some rays!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_0,WHEW! It's a hot one. Seven inches from the midday SUN out here!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_1,I know just the way to beat the heat. A MOVIE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_2,Let's just see what's playing... Wait a minute. Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine?! In theaters now?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_3,"PRACTICE YOUR AUTOGRAPH, LOGAN! WE'RE GONNA BE STARS!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_4,What in the hell are you talking about?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_INTRO_5,"Don't sweat it, let's just get to the multiplex! Say, you get a senior citizen discount, right?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_START_0,"Wow, us in our own movie. Smile, Logan, we're taking a picture to commemorate the occasion."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_START_1,"Hey buddy, can you turn your phone off? I'm tryna watch the movie."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_START_2,"Oh, sorry! Let me just get my attacks in for Alliance War, finish my online shopping and take 100 more selfies..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_03_START_3,THAT'S IT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_0,"Yeesh! Kicked out of our own movie. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_1,"I guess I'll just have to buy another ticket. In fact, anyone reading this should buy as many tickets as they can."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_2,Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine! In theaters now!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_3,Mr. Wilson... I believe you're responsible for the sudden influx of super heroes in this town.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_4,I am! And you sound REALLY excited about it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_INTRO_5,"Yes, allow me to share that\njoy with you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_START_0,"Willy, I'm sorry! How did I know you had a big criminal operation going on here?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_START_1,I don't. I own the resort you're staying at. And I'm collecting my bill from YOU.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_0,Oof... Okay... I'll pay the tab. How much is it?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_1,"My assistant is e-mailing you a bill. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_2,Let me just take a big gulp of water while I open this attachment and...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_3,AAAAH! Do you know how unpleasant it is to do a spit take with this mask on?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_4,"I don't have this kind of money! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_5,I suggest you find it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_6,Or what?\nYou'll throw your goons at me?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_03_04_END_7,Worse. My lawyers.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_0,How are we going to pay this bill?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_1,Sorry... We?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_2,You and me! Didn't you see the ampersand in the title of the movie?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_3,"Musta be getting popcorn when that showed up. Good luck, Wade."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_4,"Lousy Wolverine, can't even bother any of his extremely rich friends..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_INTRO_5,"Wait a minute! I know those friends! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_START_0,"Sir, this is a members only resort. I'm afraid you're trespassing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_START_1,"Oh, it's okay, I'm close personal friends with Mr. Stark! Or whoever's the richest person here."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_START_2,"Security! Escort this... person? ...off the premises. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_END_0,What in the WORLD is all this racket? Some of us are trying to relax while avoiding a tan.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_END_1,"Emma! You can help me out. I've got a MASSIVE bill to pay! Kingpin's going to take my THUMBS! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_END_2,I need those to play the many fine Scopely mobile games!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_01_END_3,"Tony! Someone in tactical spandex is asking for money. Be a dear and throw him out, will you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_0,"When it comes to saving the world, you know I'll be there. But you wracked up this tab on your own. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_1,"Not just on my own! She-Hulk needed four private cabana boys! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_2,"Look, you're not going to miss it! You've got Avengers: Endgame money!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_3,Is he still here? We need to pay for better security.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_4,"YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S IT! This slob's had enough of you snobs!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_INTRO_5,I challenge you a battle in the style of our forefathers... SUMMER CAMP GAMES!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_START_0,"Our resort versus yours! We win, you guys pay our tab! You win, I polish your suit every day for a year. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_START_1,"Okay, I do like a good bet. What should we start with?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_START_2,How about... TAG!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_END_0,"Ha! AND NOW YOU'RE OUT! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_END_1,"You've got Kitty Pryde on your team! How were we supposed to tag her? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_END_2,"SOMEONE should have called ""no powers"". Time for game two!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_02_END_3,EVERYBODY LIMBO!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_0,"I definitely wouldn't have proposed limbo if I knew you guys had Mr. Fantastic on your team. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_1,"Now who should have called\n""no powers""?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_2,"It's fine, he made it up to us in\ntug-of-war. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_3,"He was a GREAT rope, by the way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_4,"But I've saved the best game for last. This one is for all the marbles! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_5,And by marbles I mean money.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_INTRO_6,CAPTURE THE FLAG!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_START_0,"So, what's your secret weapon this time, Deadpool? We've got Quicksilver, you can't outrun us. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_START_1,"Hey, when flags are involved there's only one person I call. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_START_2,"Sorry, Tony. I'm a man of the people. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_0,Get back here with that flag! It's three days from retirement!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_1,"Not a chance, Wade. Sorry, but once I get this back to our base, it's game over for you and your gang of misfits."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_2,SNIKT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_3,The flag!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_4,"Sorry, darlin'. Much as I can't stand Wade, I can't stand you snooty jerks getting one over on us more. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_5,"WOLVIE! I knew you cared! Come here, you big so-and-so. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_03_END_6,"Just pay yer bill, Wade.\nYou owe me one. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_0,"We ruined a pool, crashed a Helicarrier, beat the rich kids AND got kicked out of a movie theater!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_1,I sure hope we all stay friends once school starts up again...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_2,What a great weekend!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_3,"Wait a minute... End of the weekend... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_4,FURY'S GONNA BE BACK AT ANY MOMENT!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_INTRO_5,I've gotta clean up after this party and get the Helicarrier back before Fury shows up!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_START_0,"Helicarrier's back in the air, time to get back to Manhattan and no one will be the wiser..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_START_1,"COWER, ACAPULCO RESORT MEMBERS! REJECT DOOM'S APPLICATION?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_START_2,ALL WHO VACATION HERE SHALL FEEL THE WRATH OF DOOM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_START_3,"Okay, I feel like this shouldn't be my problem. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_0,"Doom out of the way, Helicarrier mostly cleaned up, pool drained. I think we might make it!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_1,"Deadpool, bad news! Fury's Quinjet just hit the atmosphere. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_2,GASP! We're out of time!\nHIT THE JETS!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_3,BOOOOOOOM!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_4,"Two damned days and no one wanted to share a single secret. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_5,"When we assembled a ""Council of Fury's"" we shouldn't have expected a lot of trust..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_6,"Looks like we didn't miss much, at least. I guess we shouldn't have worried."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_7,...are they gone?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_8,"WE GOT AWAY WITH IT. Great job, everyone!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_POOLPARTY_04_04_END_9,Can't wait for NEXT weekend!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_INTRO_0,NEXUS EARTH.\nARES SURVEYS A BATTLEFIELD...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_INTRO_1,This? This is where the call of war has brought me?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_INTRO_2,What is it now? Mortals contending for land? Resources?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_INTRO_3,"Ah, a test of might."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_INTRO_4,"Prepare yourselves, Mortals. Ares enters the fray."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_START_0,You are NOT authorized to be here!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_END_0,Foolish mortals.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_END_1,I am the God of War. I am the only one with the right to be here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_END_2,That changes today.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_01_END_3,Now you look like a worthy opponent.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_02_END_0,"As they say, looks are deceiving."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_02_END_1,Not you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_02_END_2,"Jane, contact Fury. We need to join with our enemies against Ares."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_02_END_3,Fear not. Our story doesn't end here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_02_END_4,End? I will erase your story.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_03_END_0,"Disappointing, as usual."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_INTRO_0,You there! Which side of this war are you on?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_INTRO_1,"Never mind, it doesn't matter. You will all meet the same fate."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_INTRO_2,This is the guy we're supposed to be worried about?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_END_0,"Worried or not, your fates are all sealed."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_END_1,To label such a weak match-up as 'war' is pitiful.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_04_END_2,Is there no one here worthy of facing me in glorious battle?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_05_START_0,"You have a funny way of testing someone's worth, but I'm up for it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_05_START_1,"Tony, no! Fury said to wait for reinforcements."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_05_END_0,Tony? Pepper? Where are they?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_05_END_1,In the scrap heap.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_06_START_0,"Buddy, you picked the wrong ship to board."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_INTRO_0,"Hela, get those zombies moving!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_INTRO_1,"Mind your tongue girl, you speak to a goddess!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_INTRO_2,Excellent.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_INTRO_3,I've long sought a battle with these decaying aberrations.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_END_0,You have no idea the resources that were sunk into this exercise just for you to ruin it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_END_1,An exercise? I haven't broken a sweat yet.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_07_END_2,Let's see if my friends can help you with their magic touch in that case.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_MID_0,"Fury, he's too strong!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_0,You are the Fury I've been hearing about.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_1,You coordinated a counterattack on me with your enemies.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_2,That I did.\nI assume you're not too happy about that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_3,It was... entertaining. But to rally your enemies alongside you is a mark of a great leader.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_4,Your soldiers should match your skill.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_5,Hold on. What are you saying here?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_6,"These exercises of yours, I wish to participate in them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ARES_08_END_7,I will whip your soldiers into fighting shape... or destroy them in the process.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_0,Well?! Do you have it?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_1,"Patience, beast. This Krakoan portal uses a blend of mutant and mystic energies. It's not easily deciphered. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_2,"If you expect patience from our master, sorcerer, you're going to cost us both our lives!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_3,He needs access to these portals for his plans...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_4,Then he had best adjust them. Anyone seeking to harm mutantkind must first face me...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_INTRO_5,"Magneto, Master of Magnetism!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_START_0,"I don't care what evil you seek to unleash, monsters. But I will make you regret ever bringing it to my door. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_START_1,"Typical Erik, usin' four words when none would do. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_START_2,"Wolverine. If you're going to interrupt, make yourself useful. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_START_3,"My pleasure, bub. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_0,"Call your friends at S.T.R.I.K.E., see if they can take this refuse away. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_1,"I ain't your messenger. Besides, we got more important business. Frost?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_2,"We're here to talk about your dreams, Erik. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_3,"Reading my thoughts uninvited? I thought you'd know better, Emma."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_4,"It's not my fault, darling. Your mind is doing the equivalent of snoring so loudly the astral plane shakes. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_5,"Your mind is crying out one word in your sleep. One we've been searching for since Wolverine arrived in our world. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_6,"""Charles""."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_7,"I hate to disappoint, but that name means nothing to me. Whatever you claim I'm thinking... I can't help you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_8,"Oh, we don't expect you can simply tell us what we want to know."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_01_END_9,For that... We need to go inside your mind.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_0,"I wear this helmet to make sure my mind stays my own, and now you want me to let you in willingly?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_1,"You got a clue to a mystery I'm trying to solve rattlin' around in there. One that could help all Mutants. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_2,And I'm simply supposed to trust you'll do no harm once in there?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_3,"You'll be with us, your conscious mind exploring your subconscious. People pay good money for that kind of therapy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_4,"Erik... We came because your mind is crying out. That name, Charles... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_5,It really means nothing to you?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_6,"...No. Not nothing. It stirs a feeling... But for what reason, I do not know."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_7,Very well. We shall explore the mind of Magneto. But be warned.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_INTRO_8,"You may not like what you find. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_START_0,Oi! Looks like we got some uninvited guests! Time to fry!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_START_1,"The Brotherhood? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_START_2,"Projections of your mind. But in here, no less deadly. Prepare for a fight!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_0,"Went down pretty easy. I see you don't think much more of yer former lackeys than I do. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_1,"Despite some of their failings, the Brotherhood was always loyal. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_2,"Unlike some, they joined my ranks not to protect a status quo, but to change the world for Mutantkind. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_3,"I respect them, Logan. Enough that they'd be my mind's first line of defense. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_4,So yer sayin' there's more to come?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_02_END_5,"If I know my mind... We'll soon face much more resistance. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_INTRO_0,I've given you full access to my mind. What have you found?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_INTRO_1,"You think you have, but your mind is quite powerful. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_INTRO_2,"It's rather borderline impressive, if I'm being honest. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_INTRO_3,But I'm sensing some scarring... Psychic alterations leading this way. Directly to...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_INTRO_4,Us. Stand down.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_START_0,"Your days of aiding the oppressed are over, Magneto! We're taking you in, in the name of humanity!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_START_1,Jeeze. Is this really what you think the X-Men sound like?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_START_2,RAARGH! WOOF! SNARL!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_START_3,"Try not to take it personally. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_END_0,"I can't tell who that was more embarassin' for, Mags - us or you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_END_1,"We're at the most superficial layer of his mind, Logan. Where base thoughts guard a deeper understanding."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_03_END_2,"For us to find what we're looking for, we have to go much deeper. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_0,"There... We're through to the next layer. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_1,All this concrete and glass. What is this place?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_2,"Surrounded by mind readers and none of them can tell. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_3,"This is where I would be if the so-called heroes of your world had their way. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_4,"This is my prison. The one they built for me, that I've narrowly escaped from."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_INTRO_5,"And guess what, silver fox. I'm putting you right back in."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_START_0,"Of course. The Avengers. The X-Men I have always respected. You, however... Humanity's dogs. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_START_1,"Big talk for a guy in purple underwear. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_START_2,"My conscience kept me in check in the real world, Stark. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_START_3,"In my mind, I can finally show the so-called Iron Man the unbridled power of Magneto!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_0,"Sadly the real Stark will never know that I could dismantle him with a thought. But that I know it, maybe, is enough."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_1,"Pretty gruesome, even for me. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_2,"What's the deal, Mags? You ain't got any happy thoughts in this place?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_3,"The lives we've lived, Wolverine... Do you really believe either of us deserve them?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_4,"You have happy memories, Erik. I know. I've been a part of some of them."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_5,"But wherever these traces are leading us is buried behind hate and fear... "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_04_END_6,"We'll find our answers, if only we push past them."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_0,Focus on the thread. On the name Charles. Tell us what you feel...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_1,I sense... Great frustration... Disappointment...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_2,"But also something else. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_3,"Frustration and disappointment. Are you sure you aren't thinking of us? "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_4,"Those may as well have been the names you gave us in the Brotherhood. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_INTRO_5,Now he has no choice. He can't ignore us. Not for the few moments he has left!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_START_0,"No... My children. Please, I can't face these specters. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_START_1,"Sorry, father. It's time you answered to the next generation. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_0,Do you know how hard it was to try and live up to your expectations?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_1,Of you disapproving or coddling us?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_2,"Outright disowning us? Stand and fight, old man. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_3,NO!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_4,"I will not fight you. Of my own blood or not, you are all three my children. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_5,"Each of you carry my teachings, my spirit, my strength. Even when you stood against me, I felt one thing."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_6,"Pride. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_05_END_7,"I love you. Even if you hate me. Now, my children, let us pass."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_0,"Erik, do you want to talk about what just happened? Are you okay?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_1,"What will put me at peace, Jean, is having you out of my mind. Let's press on."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_2,"Whatever you want, Erik. I just... AHH! I was just hit with such an intense wave of hatred!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_3,"Really? I thought this journey to my soul would reveal that hatred is not something I value. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_4,Not from you... For you! For everything!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_INTRO_5,Greetings... Herr Magnus.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_START_0,Hydra! And not just a few of 'em! A whole dang legion!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_START_1,"My first taste of what humanity could do to we mutants if left unchecked. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_START_2,I've spent my life fighting them. I will not let them take space in my mind any longer!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_0,"Take your evil, and be gone from my soul, Skull!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_1,AAAAAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_2,*CRASH*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_3,"...They are gone, for now."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_4,For now? Ya brought this whole section of your mind down around 'em. They ain't coming back.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_5,"I have learned, Logan, over the last eighty years, a horrible truth - they always come back. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_06_END_6,Which is why I will never stop fighting.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_0,The psychic trail leads here... A giant metal vault.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_1,"Not particularly subtle, darling. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_2,What better place to store my greatest secrets and fears that in a vessel I have complete control over?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_3,"Your answers may lay inside. But if it is truly guarded by my deepest fear, we will face an opponent I've never defeated. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_4,Oh yeah? Who's that?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_INTRO_5,Myself.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_START_0,"YOU. You have held us back for too long with your morals, and your pity. You're weak. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_START_1,"I shall destroy you, and we will achieve our destiny - the complete extinction of humanity!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_0,"I said I do not value hatred... But that doesn't mean I don't sometimes indulge in it. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_1,Humanity has done so much... Taken so much... My darkest fear is I forgo my soul in exchange for revenge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_2,That I become no better than them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_3,"Now, do you find what you seek? Can we be gone from this place?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_4,"You said, when focusing on the name Charles, you felt something else. Can you feel that again?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_5,"I feel not just frustration, but kinship. Respect. And beyond that... Love."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_6,Wait... There... I've found it... It's... AHH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_7,Jeanie! What'd you see?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_8,"Whoever altered your mind, Erik. Your helmet must have made it more difficult than expected. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_9,"They accidentally left a sign of their meddling where your memories of Charles were. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_AGEOFX_CH1_07_END_10,"A looming darkness. A great powerful void. Almost... A shadow. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_0,"Cosmo, come in! Any luck finding our newest recruit?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_1,"Nyet, Comrade Quill. We have been searching this sector but no luck! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_2,I worry he is like the accursed tail that I may never catch!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_3,"Rocket says the tracker he built should lead you right to him.\nKeep looking. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_4,Tell 'em to give it a whack if it ain't workin' right!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_5,"Da, will do! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_6,"Cosmo, my friend. I am afraid  we have enemies approaching.  "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_7,Here?! We thought it was lightyears away...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_INTRO_8,"Even at this end of the galaxy... The Phalanx force has found us. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_START_0,"Organics! Even you, metal one. You will become one with the Phalanx!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_START_1,"Wait, something on the radar... Something arriving fast!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_START_2,You shall go no further techno-organic invaders! Not today. Not while GLADIATOR still stands!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_0,"These fools dare attack here, at the edge of the Shi'ar Empire..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_1,"The impudence. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_2,"Gladiator, thank goodness! We have come to ask your help. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_3,"Then you've come to receive my refusal and nothing else. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_4,"I have faced the Phalanx before. I shall face them again. I will stand between them and the Shi'ar Empire. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_5,"You can only stand against them for so long, Gladiator. Something about the Phalanx has changed. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_01_END_6,Their hive-mind is being controlled by a new leader. Someone known as... Ultron.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_0,"Cosmo, did you find him? Put me on speakerphone, or whatever your shuttle has. Space speaker? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_1,"Star-Lord. I do not deign to converse with Terran pirates. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_2,"Wow, you've heard of me?! Gladiator's heard of me. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_3,"Speak quickly. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_4,"Right. An artificial intelligence from Earth known as Ultron ended up in the Phalanx. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_5,"They think he's a god or something, and he's using techno-organic variants to spread through the galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_6,"They're going to take over everything. Including the Shi'ar Empire. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_INTRO_7,"Unless we can stop them. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_START_0,"More reinforcements! Their number is endless. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_START_1,"We see all, resistors. We shall consume all. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_0,"If this Ultron has infected Asgardians with his technology, things are dire indeed. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_1,"This is why we've banded together, Gladiator. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_2,"Ultimus? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_3,"Yes, and no. I am of this dimension, not the despotic invader you know.  "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_4,"Everyone has come together to stop this Ultron. He will consume us all. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_02_END_5,"Come... With you at our ranks, we must return to the front of the war. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_03_INTRO_0,"THE EDGE OF THE PHALANX INVASION, OUTSIDE KREE SPACE..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_03_INTRO_1,"Guardians, with me! We're gonna create a choke-point around that quasar!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_03_INTRO_2,"Cosmo, take your team and flank their point! Gladiator, take care of the ships!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_03_INTRO_3,Pft. The Terran issues ORDERS? And he expects me to follow them?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_03_INTRO_4,Peter Quill is the reason we've survived this long. You'd be wise to listen.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_0,"I don't understand. Why has the Terran taken charge? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_1,"Ultron is a Terran invention. When the Phalanx first began their invasion, he was the first to recognize it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_2,"Some worlds didn't listen to him. Too many. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_3,"*whimpers* They are part of the Phalanx now. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_4,"So he assembled our army, and leads from the front. Perhaps out of guilt his home world is responsible."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_INTRO_5,"Perhaps simply out of heroism. But we follow his orders, and maybe we save the Galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_0,"Is this all there is to our strategy?! We tear apart their circuits and sinew and they reassemble. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_1,"We're a bulwark, big guy. Holding the line until a key player gets here with intel. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_2,"And here I am. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_3,Ronan! My favorite Accuser. You pick up any dance moves? Or a sense of humor maybe?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_4,"One day I will feel your bones snap beneath my hammer, Peter Quill."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_04_END_5,"So, just the dance moves then. Got it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_0,"I return from the heart of the Empire with news. The Supreme Intelligence will do as you say. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_1,"Oh ho ho, I can't WAIT to get my paws on a computer that FREAKIN' big!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_2,"What plans do you have for the Supreme Intelligence? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_3,"I figure one good hive-mind deserves another. We jack the big green head into the Phalanx and turn it up to 11. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_4,"He's sayin' if we broadcast the Supreme Intelligence directly to the Phalanx, maybe it can drown Ultron out."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_5,"Hmph. This... Could work. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_INTRO_6,"Too bad none of you will live to find out. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_START_0,"I was never able to see the Kree Empire destroyed before I became one with the Phalanx. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_START_1,Now I get to see it join our ranks. Right after we destroy you!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_END_0,Woof! Skrull did not come alone! More Phalanx forces are crashing down on us!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_END_1,"And if they're tying us up here, then they're definitely..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_END_2,"On Hala. If they take the Supreme Intelligence before we can enact our plan, the fight is over."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_END_3,"Take Ronan and get there first. We'll give you cover. Surfer, Gladiator? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GLADIATOR_05_END_4,"Let's rock and roll. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_0,"EN ROUTE TO HALA, THE KREE HOMEWORLD..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_1,"I admit, it is odd serving you again. After all the damage done by your doppelganger. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_2,"Yet you do so, faithfully, Ronan. Your loyalty to the Kree is endless. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_3,*WHAM*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_4,Wha-- Something has hit the ship!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_5,"Not something, General. Someone!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_6,Those who wield the power of gods must be brought to an end!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_INTRO_7,"You are welcome to try and end me, Gorr. But you'll find it easier said than done!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_START_0,You fools! You've drawn the Phalanx directly to us!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_START_1,"We deal with them... Then we finish our fight, godling. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_END_0,"Now... Back to your DEATH,\nBeta Ray Bill!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_END_1,Not aboard my ship! Not while Hala is in danger. Who are you?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_END_2,"My name is Gorr. Though he with the Asgardian hammer would call me... The God Butcher. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_END_3,"I will destroy him, and then move on to the next. Until this Galaxy is free of their kind."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_01_END_4,"I see. But why settle for killing one with the powers of a god, when we could help you kill a new kind of god instead."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_INTRO_0,"A god of metal? Of technology and electrons? This is fascinating. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_INTRO_1,"He is called Ultron, and he has integrated himself into the very soul of the Phalanx. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_INTRO_2,"Help us kill him, Gorr the God Butcher. Before he becomes too powerful for even you to stop him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_INTRO_3,I suppose I have to see this steel god myself. Besides...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_INTRO_4,"There's always time to finish what I started later. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_START_0,"In the name of Ultron and the all encompassing Phalanx, surrender and join us, resistors. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_02_START_1,"Ooh, more Asgardians... This shall be fun. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_INTRO_0,"Those Asgardians, taken by the Phalanx. I fought them because we had to. But him?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_INTRO_1,"He took joy in it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_INTRO_2,"You're a noble warrior, Beta Ray Bill. We appreciate your aid."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_INTRO_3,"I will do whatever is needed to save us. But know that I will not allow Gorr to go free once Ultron is defeated. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_INTRO_4,"He will know justice. He will know the strength of Stormbreaker. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_END_0,"Ultimus, we are approaching Hala now. I hope we're not too late."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_END_1,"Impossible, Ronan. The Kree are destined to rule over the galaxy for eons."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_END_2,"Our glory does not end at the hands of Terran refuse. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_03_END_3,"Now, prepare for battle!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_0,"We're above the capital city, General. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_1,"The Phalanx have swarmed the city, sensors are detecting repulsor and portal energy. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_2,"More Terran technology. Sullying our home world. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_3,What's our plan?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_4,"Our ""plan""? We slice through them all. Until we've reached the very heart of this Phalanx."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_INTRO_5,"And then show it to this Ultron before we kill him. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_0,"Do you know why I do what I do, hammer-bearer?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_1,"You've spent an eon slaying gods. I can't say I care. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_2,"Ah, exactly. PRECISELY! You have the powers of Thor and yet... Apathy. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_3,"You don't want to know, you simply close your eyes and wield your power indiscriminately. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_4,"Or worse, you don't do anything at all. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_5,"So I ask, if the gods don't help, or won't help... Who will miss you when you're gone? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_04_END_6,"I intend to find out. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_INTRO_0,The foul machines breached the defenses of the Supreme Intelligence!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_INTRO_1,"I refuse to see Hala fall! Kree, allies... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_INTRO_2,"We take back our home, now!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_START_0,"Step away from the Supreme Intelligence, wretches. Ultimus will not spare you. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_START_1,"You're an error in cosmic code, Ultimus. One we seek to rectify. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_0,"Feel our hammers fall, Eternal! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_1,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_2,"Ronan and I shall keep him busy, Ultimus.  Access the Supreme Intelligence."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_3,"Supreme Intelligence! We need you now, more than ever. The fate of the galaxy rests within you. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_4,THEN THE FATE OF THE GALAXY...\nIS ULTRON.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_5,No! NO!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_6,What does this mean?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_GORR_05_END_7,It means that Hala has fallen. Hope is gone. We're too late.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_0,"Gone?! What do you mean the Supreme Intelligence is ""gone""? Is it on Island Time or something?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_1,"It's been taken by Ultron. He has Eternals, beings of Celestial technology, integrated into it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_2,Can you just like... Unplug them? Turn the Intelligence off and then turn it on again?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_3,"I will forgive this blasphemy, Terran. But no. The Eternals and Ultron must be forced out, through strength of will."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_4,"While we have immense power, few have the sheer determination to overcome it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_5,"Aw, crap. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_6,What is it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_INTRO_7,"I think I know someone who does. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_START_0,"Quill, if you're done borin' these guys to death, you might have noticed... We're UNDER ATTACK HERE!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_01_START_1,"I'm on my way! Gladiator, Surfer, hold the line. I have a new plan, I promise! It's great. I think."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_0,"I do not approve of this plan,\nPeter Quill. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_1,"I barely approve of this plan! Trust me, I would love for someone else to have a plan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_2,"Hey, I got a GREAT plan!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_3,"One where we all live at the end. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_4,"Enh, never mind. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_5,"Gladiator, Gorr, Surfer, Ultimus... You're the only ones who can do this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_6,"Head to Io, break into his prison cell, and bust him out."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_INTRO_7,"And then cross our fingers that Thanos is in a helping mood. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_START_0,"We face resistance already! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_START_1,I would expect nothing else. Guards from all over the multiverse keeping him in.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_START_2,"Forgive me for what I must do. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_END_0,"Come, the heart of the prison lies deep inside the moon."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_END_1,"You seem to know your way around, Surfer."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_END_2,"This prison was not idly built. The Infinity Watch, Earth's Avengers. We built this place together. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_END_3,We worked to make sure he would be contained.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_02_END_4,"And now, in our darkest hour, I must undo it all. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_0,"You fret too much, Surfer. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_1,Gladiator stands with you. It will be trivial to return Thanos to his cell once we're done.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_2,"Thanos from our world, perhaps. This Thanos has wiped out entire timelines with the Infinity Gauntlet. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_3,"He stepped between worlds in order to carry out his work, finding the stones in each universe. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_4,"We stopped him before he found them in ours. But what if he finds them again? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_03_INTRO_5,"Here... His Cell. We push past the final guards and we find out, together, what fate has in store. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_0,"Gladiator. Please. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_1,*SMASH*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_2,"Thanos. Come out of the dark. We need to speak with you. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_3,The four of you must be desperate indeed...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_4,"To come here, to me, for help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_5,"You have no idea. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_INTRO_6,"You better speak quickly, Surfer.\nMy jailers will find room for us both after this. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_START_0,"Back in your cell, inmate! I'm not going to ask again, there's going to be TROUBLE. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_START_1,"You think, after being held behind walls of steel, unable to unleash my fury, I wouldn't want that trouble?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_START_2,"This will be fun. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_0,You think I want to help you save this pathetic universe?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_1,I wanted to wipe it clean. Give the multiverse a blank slate. You stopped me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_2,"Now you see what comes from ignoring my warning. An infection that you can't cut out. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_3,You're a madman. Billions will die!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_4,"Billions SHOULD die. If it helps the multiverse heal. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_5,"We've wasted our time, Surfer. He cannot be convinced. Let us leave him to rot.  "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_04_END_6,Not yet. Not until he hears my offer.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_0,"We have the power, Thanos, to send you to another world."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_1,"One where you're free to pursue your madness, but far from here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_2,"Help us, and I will make sure you go free, somewhere else in the multiverse. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_3,"Heh. I might take this deal just to see the sanctimony fall from your face. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_4,"Surfer, whatever he does in those other worlds..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_5,Is on me. I carry the guilt of Galactus's crimes. Now I will carry this.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_INTRO_6,"If it means saving our universe, I can do this. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_START_0,"Before I can consider your offer, Surfer, it looks like we have one last pathetic attempt to keep us from leaving."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_START_1,"This is the Thanos that you all fear? He's nothing compared to me. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_START_2,"I am a vision of what you could have become. Now stand before me, and be judged!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_END_0,"I'll do it. I'll stop this sickness. And I will leave you to rot in it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_END_1,"One day the multiverse will heal, and scab over everyone in this Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_END_2,"This universe is worth saving. They all are. That you can't see that is true evil. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_END_3,And yet you compromised everything in order to get my aid!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_TEAM_05_END_4,"I'm glad to help you Surfer. Now I get to see the tarnish up close. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_0,"Wow, uh. You did it. Great. Thanos is here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_1,"Wasn't this all part of your very good plan, Star-Lord? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_2,"Usually people don't listen to me. I'm still getting used to this. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_3,Peter Quill. The Star-Lord. Do you want to know how I killed you on my world?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_4,I think I'm good.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_5,"Oooh, I'd like to know!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_6,"OKAY, the plan part two! Get this big purple people eater to Hala. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_INTRO_7,"One big push, everything we've got. Let's go. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_START_0,"BARK! BARK! Phalanx defenses! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_START_1,"The fight begins in earnest, Thanos. Ready yourself. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_01_START_2,"I'm more than ready, Surfer. I am inevitable. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_INTRO_0,"Hey, battle genius! You got a plan for this Kree fleet Ultron's got blockading the planet?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_INTRO_1,"Yeah, you're going to love it. It's called ""Big Boom""! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_INTRO_2,"Resistance fleet, this is Star-Lord! Open fire!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_INTRO_3,*BOOM!*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_INTRO_4,"We punched a hole for you, Surfer! Get to the Supreme Intelligence before they regroup!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_START_0,Star-Lord! We are through the blockade and on Hala! Hooray!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_START_1,Stormbreaker and I have had smoother landings...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_START_2,Landing is easy. It's surviving that you'll find impossible!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_END_0,"They keep coming. Even the power cosmic has its limits. We must end this conflict, now."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_END_1,"Lead the way, Surfer. After all... I'm your guest. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_END_2,THANOS...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_END_3,"Show yourself. I tire of whispers and tricks. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_02_END_4,THANOS... WE MUST SPEAK!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_INTRO_0,"And you must be Ultron. I thought you'd be more impressive. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_INTRO_1,"I DO NOT COME TO YOU TO IMPRESS. BUT TO REASON. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_INTRO_2,"WE SEEK THE SAME THING, TITAN. ORDER FROM CHAOS. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_INTRO_3,"YOU WISH TO DESTROY THIS WORLD. I SAY, CONTROL IT. UNITE IT AS ONE. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_INTRO_4,REMAKE IT AS ULTRON!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_END_0,"CEASE RESISTANCE. ALLOW ME TO DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_END_1,"You mistake oppression with harmony, robot. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_END_2,"I want balance, I want the multiverse to heal. How long until the cancer that is Ultron spreads?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_END_3,"No, I don't think I'll make any deals with you. I'll destroy you, and cure this world of whatever you are. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_03_END_4,"YOU WILL TRY. AND YOU WILL FAIL. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_START_0,"We have reached the Supreme Intelligence! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_START_1,"Plug Thanos into that thing, like now! Gladiator can only blow up so many Kree ships at once!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_START_2,"You've returned. Failure once wasn't enough, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_START_3,"I wasn't here before. And trust me. You would remember. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_END_0,Celestial playthings. I had hoped for a better fight.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_END_1,"Your ego isn't why we've risked everything, Thanos. Time for your iron will to show itself."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_END_2,Come closer. I shall be the bridge between the Supreme Intelligence and our minds.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_04_END_3,"Let the power cosmic connect us... And hope you're strong enough to save us all, titan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_INTRO_0,"Strange... This place... Ethereal and endless, yet solid to the touch."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_INTRO_1,"We're inside the Intelligence. Connected. This is its mind, and all our minds. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_INTRO_2,FREE ME...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_INTRO_3,"It's crying out. It needs our help, now. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_INTRO_4,"IT NEEDS NOTHING. IT IS ULTRON. AND SOON, SO SHALL YOU BE. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_START_0,These mental constructs are all that stand in the way. Defeat them and we can force Ultron from the Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_START_1,"Then come, robots. Come feel fear for the first time at the sight of Thanos!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_0,NO! I AM A GOD! I AM EVERYTHING!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_1,"You're a speck, insignificant in the face of true destiny. Goodbye, Ultron."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_2,NO! NOOOO01001111!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_3,"Did you guys do it?! The Phalanx is retreating and if this is Ultron messing with us I'm going to be so mad. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_4,"It's done, Quill. The Intelligence is free, and must have forced Ultron out. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_5,"Oh, thank god. And, uh, Thanos? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_6,"Gone. I must pursue him, whatever his plans... I'm responsible. But you saved us, Star-Lord. Be pleased."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_7,"Yes. A Terran saved us. But a Terran threat almost wiped out the entire galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANNIHILATORS_THANOS_05_END_8,"This must be reported to the Empire. Know this, Star-Lord. There will be consequences. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_0,"This is the place mentioned in the brief, right? Not at all what I imagined for the big test site."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_1,"I just checked a third time, and yeah the coordinates are right here in this… bustling shopping center."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_2,"Guess they're going for more of a ""live fire"" exercise. It's about time, let's set up the data gathering equipment before—"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_3,ARRIVAL AT DESTINATION CONFIRMED.\nBEGINNING COMBAT CALIBRATION.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_4,"Oh great, they're showing up earlier than we thought! Hurry up and get these devices transmitting or we won't hear the end of it!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_5,"Hey, at least we got the right place! I'm almost done on my end, how long do you think we—"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_6,COMBAT CALIBRATION COMPLETE.\nSCANNING FOR THREATS TO HUMANITY…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_INTRO_7,"Thanks for coming shopping with me, Bobby. Really hoping I can—wait, do you hear screaming?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_START_0,CURRENT TARGETS SUFFICIENTLY SUBDUED.\nSCANNING FOR NEW THREATS TO HUMANITY…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_START_1,People are under attack! I'll slow it down so you can get in there and do your thing.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_START_2,THREAT TO HUMANITY IDENTIFIED.\nTHREAT LEVEL: MODERATE.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_END_0,"It's bad enough we were caught off guard, but there's no end to them! We can't keep this up…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_END_1,CURRENT TARGETS SUFFICIENTLY SUBDUED.\nSCANNING FOR NEW THREATS TO HUMANITY…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_01_END_2,"Over here, you hunk of scrap!\nDon't worry you two, help is coming!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_0,"I was worried we wouldn't have the good stuff recorded, but they went at it long enough to get solid data!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_1,"Yeah, those freaks scary when they get going. Glad we'll finally be able to neutralize them…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_2,You wanna try whatever it is on me? Can't promise that I'll smile for the camera though…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_3,AAAAAH! Where did he come from? Call for help! CALL FOR HE—
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_4,"Come on, come on… Stupid macine! Why is a DISTRESS signal so slow to send…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_5,"Hey! Your friend over there wasn't much of a talker, but you look like you want to tell me what's going on."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_6,Eep!! Wait! I'll talk! …We're testing something at the shopping center over there. A weapon. It's still ongoing.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_INTRO_7,Guess you get to see what happens when it's torn to shreds. Lucky day for science.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_START_0,Mind if I have a go at 'em?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_START_1,"Wolvie?! Thank goodness, things weren't looking so great…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_START_2,"Nah, you were doing great, kid. I just wanted to join in on the fun."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_END_0,"Ma'am, sorry to bother you but we have some initial reports for you on today's tests. Some good, some bad."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_END_1,"I told you I'm very busy now, and not to bother me—go talk to the captain if it's important, Mendel loves that stuff."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_02_END_2,"Oh, me? Talk to Captain Mendel? Maybe this is my chance… Thank you, Ma'am—good luck to both of us!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_0,Ugh… is everyone okay…?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_1,Let me… catch my breath…\nI'm good. Are the others here yet?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_2,"I thought we were gonners…\nYou're the best, Wolvie!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_3,Just wanted to do my part with the recycling. Can you walk okay?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_4,"Oh, I think so. Let me get up.\nWe're so back—I think I'm good!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_5,"Hold up, I smell trouble…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_6,COMBAT CALIBRATION COMPLETE.\nSCANNING FOR THREATS TO HUMANITY…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_INTRO_7,This is the place! Let's get back online and start the second round of testing with proper support!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_START_0,"Apologies for the wait, but I have arrived. As have the others, though they are seeing to other needs."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_START_1,Things are finally looking up! I can't wait to end this and get home.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_END_0,"Things are bad down here! I repeat, things are BAD! We need to abort the tests and salvage what we can."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_END_1,"Wait, DO NOT abandon the tests! Captain Mendel said that it'll be in control soon."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_03_END_2,Just hold on for a bit longer! She'll be there soon and wrap things up.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_0,We're so cooked…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_1,"There are way more mutants here than we thought! I know they said to hold on, but…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_2,You! Where is he!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_3,"Wait, who are you? Are you the one Captain Mendel sent?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_4,WHERE IS WOLVERINE?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_5,"I, um, over there?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_6,Out of my way…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_INTRO_7,And she's gone… Is everything going to be okay now?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_START_0,"I know you're here, Wolverine! Show yourself!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_START_1,This looks to be a complication we need to resolve quickly…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_END_0,"I'll find you soon, Wolverine. And we'll settle things for good."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_END_1,"Heh, sounds like someone we know…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_04_END_2,"Ha! They wouldn't get along at all. Okay, let's get in there and get started!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_0,That intense lady sure knows what she's doing. Guess that takes care of things here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_1,The Brotherhood of Mutants has arrived!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_2,"Okay, that's it. I'm finding a place to hide until the blows over."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_3,"Things will be as they should soon, and you will all have earned what is coming!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_4,"I had a look around and this is only a test for them. Their real operation is up there, around the sun."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_5,"Let us head to the source then, and smash their hopeless ambitions into the emptiness of space."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_6,ELSEWHERE AT THE SHOPPING CENTER
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_INTRO_7,"Finally! I've found you, Wolverine. Time to end this!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_START_0,"Stand back, Scott. This one's mine."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_START_1,You're going to take on her and all those giant robots on yourself?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_START_2,"I might leave one for you to play with, if you can keep up."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_END_0,Is that the end of them? Let's figure out why this happened in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_END_1,I think this one hiding over here wants to tell us ALL about it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_SENTINEL_05_END_2,(Oh no… Do you think she means me?)
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_0,It's a bloodbath! The intercepting party is all dead! We need to lock this area down NOW!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_1,That sounds like something you would be great at! Thanks for volunteering.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_2,(The entire squad was wiped out? Does that mean the captain is…)
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_3,"Okay you, you, and you. With me, back to the lab. The rest of you are on lock down duty."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_4,"You heard her, let's move out!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_5,Let's bring this place down!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_6,"Just what I needed, a chance to let off some steam."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_INTRO_7,"Oh, looks like we have a group trying to run away. Time to make my own fun…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_START_0,One of them caught up to us! Let's try to slow him down and keep moving.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_END_0,"That seemed to put some distance between…whoever's left. More importantly, I'm back at the lab!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_END_1,"Time to try out this salvaged model I've been trying to restore, aaaand also see if the hype around AI is real."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_01_END_2,And maybe we'll pay a little tribute to the late captain…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_0,"Okay, since we've been ""volunteered"" to lock this place down, let's split up into—"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_1,"Hey! Snap out of it! This isn't the time to space out, we have to get the security systems online!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_2,"Huh? Oh, right. Right, the locks. I'll get on that."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_3,"Wait, do you know what to do? Where are you—"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_4,Burn! And never think of raising your hands against us again!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_5,"I hope she knows what she's doing, I think we're out of time…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_6,"Okay, let's try to push them back and hope for the best!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_INTRO_7,"Spread out, try to surround them!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_START_0,Are you trying to block our way? Are you trying to stop us?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_02_START_1,Do you know who I am?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_0,"Okay, here's the terminal. Emergency, emergency…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_1,Ah! I think it's this. The onboarding stuff is coming back to me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_2,"Ugh, I feel sick. Is he really gone? I never told the captain how I felt. Why I transferred to this space station."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_3,NOTICE. LOCKDOWN PROTOCOL HAS BEEN INITIATED.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_4,There we go. Now to fire up the camera feed and shepherd them through the locked sections…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_5,"HEY! Open up, let me in, quickly!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_6,"Oh! Here, come in come in! You actually pushed them back? Where are the others?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_INTRO_7,"I'm afraid none of them made it, but thanks for letting me in.\nThere are scary people running about…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_START_0,I… I don't understand…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_START_1,"My, you look devastated. It's a great look for your final moments."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_END_0,"Okay, enough. You're starting to get annoying.\nAny last words?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_03_END_1,"I'll be joining you soon, Captain Mendel…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_0,"I'll be joining you soon, Captain Mendel…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_1,Spoilers! Who told you?! Who ruined the surprise?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_2,I've arrived. Rest assured I will take care of them this time.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_3,CAPTAIN?!?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_4,"Oh, this looks like trouble."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_5,We've dealt with worse.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_6,"I see you've come back to us, just in time for the good part."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_INTRO_7,Let's not keep it waiting! We've got a lot more to break after.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_END_0,"Wow, that was amazing! This is even better than I expected!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_END_1,There are more threats approaching. My work isn't done here.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_04_END_2,"It's really him… I mean, it isn't? But, I swear that's him."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_0,"There really is a space station out here… I don't get how that works, but it's really there."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_1,Not for long it isn't. Not when we're through with it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_2,"Based on the intel we got, this is going to be serious. Don't let your guard down."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_3,Right. And remember we're here to shut down their ability to produce weapons.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_4,And see what they know about Chuck.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_5,"Yes, and gather any intel we can. Okay, we're about to dock. Be ready for anything!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_6,"I am Nimrod! Judge, jury, and executioner. You are a threat, and I will be your end!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_NIMROD_05_INTRO_7,"I'll be honest, I wasn't ready for that!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_0,"BROOKLYN, NEW YORK..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_1,Are we in the right place? If we don't find these missing runaways...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_2,"We will, Dagger. Now let me listen..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_3,I can hear eight heartbeats... All terrified. But they're alone. Time to go. Cloak?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_4,Teleporting us in...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_5,WOOSH
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_6,"Kids... It's okay, we're here to help. Who took you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_7,Can't you tell...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_INTRO_8,IT WAS US! And you're next!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_START_0,Vampires! We're surrounded!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_START_1,"Damnit, I missed them! They don't have heartbeats! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_START_2,We've got to get these kids out of here! Now!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_MID_0,"I think I'll start by eating the red one... He looks especially tender. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_MID_1,"Hey, bloodsucker! Catch!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_MID_2,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_MID_3,"Time to get back up, Daredevil. That's one down - a whole lot more to go. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_0,Blade... Thanks for your help. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't show up.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_1,"I do. I'd be putting a stake in all three of y'all now instead of dusting you off. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_2,Wow. Friendly...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_3,"I like him. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_4,"You're welcome. But you better take off. There's more to this than just some vamps, and I got work to do. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_01_END_5,"This is our city too, Blade. Fill us in. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_0,"Been a weird uptick in vamp activity around here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_1,"Usually that means some bloodsucker got too big for their fangs and is causing chaos trying to take over. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_2,"So who is it? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_3,"That's the thing. There is no new player. And the old vampire leaders are missing. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_4,"Something's happening. Don't really care what. I just know if the vamps are involved, I want to stop it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_5,So how can we help?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_6,"There's a nest up in Queens, looking to get some answers there. Could use the transport. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_INTRO_7,Then what are we waiting for? Next stop - Queens.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_START_0,"Okay, nice and quiet. I don't know how many vamps are in here, and we don't want to lose the element of... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_START_1,It's the Day Walker! He's found us!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_START_2,"Surprise. Sigh. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_MID_0,"Blade, look out! Behind you!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_MID_1,HISSSSS!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_MID_2,THWIP!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_MID_3,"Hey, gang! I was swinging by and figuyred I'd join your stakeout!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_02_MID_4,"Get it? STAKEout? Seriously, though, this is a lot of vampires. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_0,"Any leads, Blade?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_1,Lotta tech here for vamps... They're old-fashioned. They prefer magic and fangs over... Whatever this is.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_2,"Hm, actually this looks like modified Roxxon transport tech. These aren't weapons, they're basically fancy crates."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_3,I'm impressed. Can you open them up?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_4,"Sure, no sweat. I need you to answer one thing, though... How do you see while wearing those sunglasses at night?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_5,Is he going to be like this the whole time?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_INTRO_6,Just be grateful you don't have enhanced hearing.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_START_0,More vampires! Let's see how they like the light!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_0,"Got it open! Let's see what they've got in... Oh. Well. You know, I don't know what else I expected."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_1,What is it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_2,Blood! Lots of it! Gross!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_3,Why all the tech to transport blood when they could load up an ice-cream truck? This doesn't make any sense.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_4,"Well, either way, we've got the blood. They LOVE that stuff. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_5,"You're right! And we're taking it back, starting with yours!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_6,CHOMP!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_03_END_7,ARGH!!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_START_0,"Spidey, you okay? You with us?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_START_1,A little woozy... Anyone have a cookie or some orange juice?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_START_2,"This is bad. He's got an hour, tops, before he starts to turn. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_START_3,"What?! No! I can't become a vampire, I love Italian food too much."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_START_4,"I know someone who can help. But we gotta fight our way out of here first. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_END_0,"Cloak, midtown, now! Close to a subway entrance as you can get. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_END_1,"On it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_04_END_2,"And we're taking one of those crates with us. We're figuring this out. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_0,"We're here... Subway's a block away, we gotta get Spider-Man underground. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_1,"Uuuugh... Hey, is it warm in here? Or is just my full body onesie?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_2,"Oh, Daywalker! We were told to look out for you and your friends. There's nowhere to run."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_3,They're all over the damned island!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_4,That's right. So why don't you just give up rather than make us chase you?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_5,"Because they're travelling by night. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_INTRO_6,And those who do are protected by the Fist of Khonshu... The Moon Knight!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_START_0,"Welcome to the party, Moon Knight."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_START_1,There's been something off in the city for weeks. Like bugs under my skin.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_START_2," Now I know it was this infestation. And I'm more than happy to be the exterminator."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_0,"Down this tunnel, quick!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_1,"Ooof, my head is pounding. Wait, that might be your heartbeats? That seems bad, that I can hear your heartbeats."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_2,"If he turns, I'm staking him. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_3,This man has saved more lives than you can count. We're doing the same for him.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_4,"Let's just see what the doc says. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_5,"Yo, open up! We've got someone who needs medical assistance!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_BLADE_05_END_6,"Then it's a good thing you're here. Get him onto the table, quick, before the entire borough knows you're here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_INTRO_0,"Spider-Man... Can you hear me? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_INTRO_1,"Mother... Is that you? I'm coming home... Wow, you got ugly..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_INTRO_2,He's delirious.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_INTRO_3,"I think he's just irritating. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_INTRO_4,"Either way, I think I can save him. His enhanced metabolism is fighting off the vampirism enough for me to reverse it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_START_0,"Spider-Man will be okay. We just need to give him time. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_START_1,Too bad you're all out of it!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_START_2,"Oh, I think we've got all the time in the world. Let's go, bitey!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_0,I said you weren't ready for battle!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_1,"So, what? Vampires invade our home and you expect me to just hide in the corner?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_2,I'm done hiding.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_3,"Sigh. Well, I may as well give you a proper introduction. Blade, everyone... "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_4,This is the newest member of the Nightstalkers. Meet Oath.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_5,Oath...  Wait... Karen? Is that you?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_01_END_6,"Hi, Matthew. We should talk. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_0,SIX MONTHS AGO...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_1,So... So hungry...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_2,"Hey, are you okay? Can I help you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_3,HISSS! Stay away!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_4,AAAH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_5,"God, what's happened to me?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_INTRO_6,"You've been cursed, and become a wretched thing. But I can help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_START_0,"If we're going to harness your powers, and your hunger... We need to point it in the right direction."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_START_1,"These thugs have been terrorizing this community for weeks. It stops tonight. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_END_0,"I'm so hungry, but I can't... Even these jerks are people. I can't."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_02_END_1,"I know. You could have drank from that bystander, but you didn't. And that's why I want to teach you. Come with me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_0,"My name is Karen, Karen Page. You're Michael Morbius, right? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_1,I'm surprised you're familiar with me.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_2,"I'm a reporter. And I've had plenty of... Experience... with metahumans. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_3,"I was following a lead, looking for missing unhoused people all over the city. No one cared."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_4,"But you did. And then you found out why they were going missing. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_INTRO_5,"I sneaked into their base, but before I knew it... I was bitten."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_START_0,Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_START_1,"An A.I.M. facility, half abandoned. They have chemicals we need. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_03_START_2,But they won't give them up willingly! Come!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_INTRO_0,"When I first transformed myself into the monstrocity you see before you, I was also overcome with the hunger. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_INTRO_1,"Using the chemicals from the AIM base, I recreated this for you, one of my greatest inventions..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_INTRO_2,"Artificial blood. Not suitable for most humans, but it will sate your thirst. And do much more."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_INTRO_3,"Oh... Oh god... I feel, I feel... Amazing."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_INTRO_4,"You're unlocking your full potential. Come, let's see what you can do. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_0,This is incredible! I've never felt so good in my life!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_1,"Ugh, please, no more..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_2,Karen! Be careful!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_3,Why should I? These monsters don't care who they hurt!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_4,AAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_5,Karen! Release him! Now!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_04_END_6,"Oh my god, I'm... I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_0,"It was the power. The hunger gone, I was intoxicated with my new ability to finally strike back. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_1,"Michael said he would continue to train me, but I can tell he thinks I'll give in again."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_2,"But I made a promise to myself to never lose control again. I took an Oath. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_3,And now I want to help stop these vampires.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_4,"Karen, this is... This is a lot to take in. But I'm glad you're okay."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_INTRO_5,"None of us are going to be okay if you two don't stop standing around! The vamps are back. Time to go. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_START_0,Destroy them... Tear this place to the ground!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_START_1,"Oh, come on! I just found out about it, I haven't even had time to post a review online!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_START_2,"4 Stars - great cobwebs and perfect sewer stench, but has a real pest problem. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_0,"How are you feeling, Spider-Man?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_1,"Not a vampire, thanks to Morbius. Which is great news for us all, since I look awful in a cape."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_2,Great. Glad to hear it. Tell us about the damned box.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_3,"I can see why they call you the Daywalker, you're a real ray of sunshine."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_4,"This crate is shielded from all kinds of radiation, more than you'd need to just store blood. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_5,"This is what I'd keep it in if I was worried about getting it through deep space, or, I don't know..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_OATH_05_END_6,"To another dimension. This is bad. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_0,DEEP IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_1,"Hey, you think what they say about this place is true? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_2,What? That there's a giant plant man who sets people on fire? Come on.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_3,"Oh, like it's so crazy? There's a guy made out of rock that lives in a New York penthouse. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_4,"Ah, that's different. Forget it, we gotta finish patrol. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_5,I don't see how it's that different...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_INTRO_6,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_START_0,"Hey, did you hear that?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_START_1,"Har har. Good one, Jeff. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_01_START_2,"No, I'm serious... What is THAT?!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_0,"Well done, Doctor Sallis. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_1,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_2,"Fine... ""Ted"". "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_3,You've done an admirable job defending your home from criminals and poachers.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_4,"But there's a much darker force coming... And I think we can help each other fight it off. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_INTRO_5,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_START_0,"Behold, the undead! They're corrupting the very soil around us. We need to remove them."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_END_0,"Hm, odd. Their auras are unlike anything I've seen before. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_END_1,"That's because they're not normal vamps, Harkness. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_END_2,"Blade. And you brought friends? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_END_3,"Hello, Theodore. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_02_END_4,...!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_0,"What is that? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_1,"That is Doctor Theodore Sallis. A genius biochemist... Like so many of us, an accident befell him and now he's this."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_2,"The Man-Thing. Protector of the Nexus of Realities. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_3,...?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_4,"Yes, we believe something is threatening the Nexus, friend. Vampires. Vampries from another dimension."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_INTRO_5,"Okay, I admit it... This is taking some getting used to. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_0,"So, this is why the mystical disturbances are converging here... A breach at the heart of our world. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_1,"I think a bloodsucker is looking for fresh blood, and is using us as their own personal stash."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_2,"So we stop it. But we need your help, Man-Thing. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_3,"Can you take us to the Nexus? Wherever they're sending the blood... It's going through there. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_4,...!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_03_END_5,"He's mad. Perfect. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_START_1,We're here! That looks like a portal? Is that where they're sending the blood?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_START_2,"I'm used to portals at this point, but that one looks less stable than normal. Let's take it out before it's too late."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_0,Retreat! The daywalker and the guardian have found us!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_1,...!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_2,AAAAAGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_3,What did he do?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_4,"Whatever knows fear, my dear, burns at the touch of the Man-Thing. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_04_END_5,Then I think you'll find me much harder to set ablaze.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_INTRO_0,"Blade. You simply had to interrupt my perfectly good supply of blood, hm?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_INTRO_1,"Yeah, I've got a real problem with you overgrown ticks getting fat in my backyard. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_INTRO_2,"Well, at least you've done me the favor of sticking around so we can kill you."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_INTRO_3,Subjects? FEAST!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_START_0,"Man-Thing, take as many vamps out as you can. I'm going for their queen. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_START_1,"Come and get it, if you can. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_0,"A shame. The version of you on my world put up more of a fight. Or maybe I'm just that much stronger. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_1,"Either way... Enjoy your death, dhampir. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_2,"Cat, you know the benefit of being the coolest $%&@ in the room? All eyes are on me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_3,HIYAH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_4,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_5,"Nice work, Oath. Knight. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_6,"Always happy to bury some darts in evil's back. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_7,"But she's retreating! Are they gone for good? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_MANTHING_05_END_8,"No way. So we're following, and putting an end to this, now. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_0,"ACROSS DIMENSIONS, AN EARTH OF DARKNESS..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_1,Oh god... What happened here? The world looks... Dead?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_2,...!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_3,"Man-Thing doesn't seem happy about any of this. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_4,Look above you. No sun. No moon. The Vampires have somehow shielded this place from its rays completely.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_5,This world is a tomb overrun with vermin.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_INTRO_6,Sniff... Sniff... Can it be?! Do I smell... BLOOD?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_END_0,Those weren't just normal vampires... Those were people we knew on our world. Super powered people.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_END_1,"They stake all the same. We find Black Cat, destroy whatever operation she's got, and get back to our Earth."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_01_END_2,"You'll be lunch long before that, Blade. Unless you come with me. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_0,"The second you arrived here, our sensors detected that you were alive. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_1,There are those of us who are immune to the vampire virus...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_2,Curse.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_3,"Whatever you choose to believe it is, some of us can't be turned. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_4,"So we protect the last bastion of humanity, here underground. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_5,"So, what? You want our help saving this world? Seems pretty far gone. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_6,"You're right. We can't save this world. What we want is safe passage to yours. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_7,Just as soon as we get rid of the vampire among you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_INTRO_8,Wait... Me?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_START_0,"Oath's not going anywhere. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_START_1,"Blade defending a vampire? Your world has gone soft. We'll take her out ourselves. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_END_0,"If you're really the last of humanity, I recommend standing down before there's no one left. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_END_1,Rrrr... If you think I'm going to let your vampire friend in here...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_02_END_2,"Stand down, Banner. I'm calling the shots. And I say we need them. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_0,"Carol. Thanks for that. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_1,Don't thank me. I've spent years turning anything with fangs to dust. I didn't do this because I like you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_2,"I did this because my friend here thinks you can help save lives. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_3,"Hello, Blade. ...Agatha. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_4,Richards. How did you survive?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_INTRO_5,"You can't bite through elastic skin, thankfully. But if you're ready to hear it... I have a plan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_START_0,"Was this really the only way Mr. Fantastic said we could get to Black Cat? I'm already sick of the sewers. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_START_1,"Here I thought journalists were used to getting their hands dirty. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_START_2,There's dirt and then there's... Bleck!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_03_START_3,"Shhh! We've got company. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_INTRO_0,"Dr. Richards, we've reached the basement of Black Cat's citadel. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_INTRO_1,"Excellent work. Use the decryption key I gave you to crack their access codes. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_INTRO_2,It's doing it's thing...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_INTRO_3,"Once inside, grab the portal tech she stole from the Baxter Building after we had to abandon it. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_INTRO_4,"We can use that to get these people back to your world and seal this cursed place off forever. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_START_0,"Once you're inside, be prepared to meet..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_START_1,"I take it Reed sentcha? Whadda revoltin' development. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_START_2,"Resistence. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_0,"Oh, Benjamin... What has happened to you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_1,You mean the fangs? They finally got through my rocky hide an' showed me what I was missin'!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_2,"You put uppa good fight, but it's time to end this..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_3,A shame... I always liked you best. Ted?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_4,...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_04_END_5,AAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_INTRO_0,"We're in. Knight, you know which piece of tech Richards wanted?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_INTRO_1,"Got eyes on it. Entering the sequence he gave us, should be good to go in just..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_INTRO_2,"Longer than you've got! You fools followed me here? To the source of my power? "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_INTRO_3,My army will destroy you!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_INTRO_4,"Ain't done it yet. Nightstalkers? Slice 'em up. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_0,You'll join us or be torn to shreds! Then we'll find that pathetic human resistance and drain them dry!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_1,"Nothing living can stand against me and the forces of the undead! "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_2,"You're making an excellent point, dear. PH'NGLUI, MGLW'NAFT, CTHON K'LAY..."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_3,What is she doing?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_4,Calling in some help.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_MID_5,...RRRRAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_0,They're trying to devour each other! This is disgusting!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_1,"We've got the box! Let's get out of here. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_2,No! NO! You're not going to get away. We'll follow you to the ends of the earth!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_3,"Thought you'd say that. So I left a little surprise for you. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_4,And Cat? Stay out of Brooklyn. *beep*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_5,BOOM!!!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_6,"Nice. They're sealed in. It won't hold them. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_7,"By the time they're free, we'll be long gone and they'll be stuck with Agatha's special friends. "
ID_DIALOG_SSE_NIGHTSTALKERS_TEAM_05_END_8,Let's go get those people a new home. Nightstalkers... Nice work.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_01_INTRO_0,"If you can hear this message, our ""guests"" got away."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_01_INTRO_1,Meet me at my lab and keep them from breaking anything else
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_01_INTRO_2,Copy that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_01_INTRO_3,"I need to go, so let's make this quick."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_0,"We're almost to the lab! Once we're in, start backing up the AI work."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_1,I think I finally got something usable from it!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_2,"So that wasn't really the captain then, right? Just AI?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_3,"Isn't it great? His memory lives on, as does his love for killing threats!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_4,What could possibly go wrong?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_5,"I'm here, what do you need?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_02_INTRO_6,Stop this guy chasing us!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_03_INTRO_0,We're coming up on the main lab!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_03_INTRO_1,"Let's wipe out their data, and move on to shut the rest of this place down."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_03_END_0,This is too much to deal with!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_03_END_1,"I got what I needed anyway, so let's regroup with Nimrod. Quickly!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_INTRO_0,"Shuttle is docking with the Orchis Forge, ma'am."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_INTRO_1,"Good. Wolverine will soon learn he can't escape my wrath, even in space."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_INTRO_2,"You've held up well for this long, but this is the end for you and your kind."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_INTRO_3,Oh! We made it in time for the best part!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_END_0,We did it! And no humans were harmed in the process!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_END_1,"Are you doing okay there, captain? You took quite the hit."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_04_END_2,…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_0,"Most of his systems seem fine, but the personality layer is off."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_1,"Ah, that's a little sad, but I guess it was never really him…"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_2,"Oh, he's moving again! And he's reaching out to comfort me."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_3,I've come to realize that it's not just mutants that are dangerous…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_4,*SNAP*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_5,"Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope! I'm out of here!!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_OMEGASENTINEL_05_INTRO_6,Humans must also be eliminated.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_0,"That should do it for wiping out everything in the lab, but—"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_1,"Hi again! I'm not interrupting anything, am I?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_2,X-Men—
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_3,Wait! I've had a very sudden change of heart about AI.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_4,And I would love to help you all in exchange for a nice safe trip to Earth
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_5,*SNIKT*
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_6,"Wait, Logan. We don't have time and we haven't found info on Charles."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_7,"Help us shut this place down, and give us access the data you've been recording."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_01_INTRO_8,Deal! We can split up to save time. We sort of need to hurry…
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_03_INTRO_0,"Okay, this should be the last of the Sentinels!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_03_INTRO_1,Best news I've heard in a while.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_04_INTRO_0,"One last hunk of tin to slice through, and we can head home."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_04_INTRO_1,"You will be eliminated here and now, and cast out into the sun!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_0,"Okay, we're on the way back home. Start talking."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_1,"Fair enough, you held up your end of the deal."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_2,"I've never heard of the guy you're talking about, but look here."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_3,The Orchis Forge's local data show he was being monitored.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_4,"That's not the case in the source data back home, but here you go."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_5,That's his last known location. The updates stopped at some point.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_6,"Buckle up, we're about to land."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_INTRO_7,(Time for me to sneak off before I have to answer for anything.)
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_START_0,Who are you?! I thought I made a perfectly clean getaway.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_START_1,Just here to fix an oversight. This won't hurt. Much.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_END_0,"There we go, just forget all about Charles."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ORCHIS_TEAM_05_END_1,Who?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_0,"Back for Round 2 so soon, Hela? Couldn't let the dead rest longer?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_1,"Call me petty, but I really felt our last face-off should have played out differently."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_2,"Are you taking that old saying to heart? ""When seeking revenge, dig two graves."""
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_3,In a sense. You get to see my own take on it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_4,It's much better digging up THREE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_5,Uungh…
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_6,Ha! You think one more shambling horror will make a difference?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_INTRO_7,"I've been training Fury's finest for war. If your horde gets through them, you'll have your rematch."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_START_0,Anyone find this unsettling? These zombies look scary… and hungry!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_START_1,I think it's great that Hela's taking the kids out trick or treating. I wish I had some candy to give out for those cute little costumes.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_START_2,You lot really are pests. I think I'm going to enjoy this warm up.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_END_0,ARGGHH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_END_1,This might be more entertaining than I thought!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_01_END_2,"Let's see how you do against the rest of Fury's elite. I'll be waiting, Hela!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_0,"OMG! Hela, I've been dying to chat with you! I was hoping we could do a collab sometime. Like, we could—"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_1,"Easy there, pumpkin. Can't you see the nice lady is busy taking her kids out trick or treating?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_2,"Ugh, someone already made that joke. Do you all Spider-people share the same material?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_3,I…
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_4,*giggle* *SNORT*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_5,Heh…
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_6,"My own daughter laughing at me I could take, but… THE Wolverine?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_INTRO_7,"I'm gonna dice your little friends up and leave them in the compost bin, Hela. MAXIMUM PETTINESS!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_START_0,"Okay, who wants to be the first victim in the Deadpool Halloween Grindhouse Special?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_START_1,ARGGHH!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_START_2,"Dad, watch out for this one—she's not like the others!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_END_0,Uungh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_END_1,"Okay, bye! Hela, DM me sometime!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_02_END_2,"Still trying to delay the inevitable, Ares? Or are you finally ready?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_0,Argghh!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_1,"I'll admit, this undead witch of chaos is a very powerful weapon in war."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_2,"You'll have your rematch, Hela."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_3,Don't hold it against me if we savor this.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_4,"You kept us waiting an awfully long time, and now we hunger."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_5,ARGGHH!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_INTRO_6,"…for different things, but we're eager to battle all the same."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_START_0,AARGGHH!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_START_1,RRAAAAAHH!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_END_0,"Ah, victory is sweet! A pity this feeling won't last forever, but damn if it doesn't feel good."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_END_1,"The defeat stings, but a good fight invigorates me. It empowers me. Next time I'll hold nothing back."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_HALLOWEEN2024_03_END_2,"Happy Halloween, Commander!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_INTRO_0,*BEEP BEEP*\nATTENTION COMMANDERS!\nASSISTANCE REQUESTED!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_INTRO_1,REPORT TO HELL'S KITCHEN FOR VALUABLE INSIGHTS AND FIELD EXPERIENCE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_START_0,Finally! Reinforcements have arrived!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_START_1,"Watch out, folks! Kree Reaper is a Brawler. They prefer to get up close and personal with their foes for maximum damage!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_WAVE2_0,Uh-oh. Kree Royal Guard is a Protector. They take the brunt of the damage in order to protect their teammates Let's think about how we'll attack.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_WAVE3_0,Looks like they invited friends.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_WAVE3_1,Kree Oracle is classified as Support. We can expect them to assist their allies with healing and positive combat effects.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_WAVE4_0,"Kree Cyborg has been called in. As a Blaster, they'll bombard enemies with damage at long range."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_WAVE5_0,Kree Noble is the team's Controller. They're going to manipulate the battlefield by disrupting their foes and providing special benefits to their allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_01_END_0,Someone's coordinating this attack. Go on ahead and see if you can find out who.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_START_0,Great timing! My Venom Strike is slowing these guys down. Mind giving me a hand?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_START_1,"You probably noticed this already, but a higher speed means you can engage your enemies faster."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_WAVE2_0,That Speed Up effect will help them move sooner than usual. Be careful!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_WAVE3_0,Keep an eye on Vulture! His Passive Ability helps speed him up when a character is defeated.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_END_0,He got away. At least we know he's involved somehow.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_02_END_1,I'll handle the stragglers here. I'm sure someone else will need help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_03_START_0,Check this out.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_03_START_1,Some of us have abilities that can place positive or negative status effects on others.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_03_WAVE2_0,These guys are no joke. Mind those status effects!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_03_END_0,You're looking for Vulture? He flew by not too long ago.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_START_0,"Not so fast, everyone!\nThese guys have abilities that will make them tricky to hit with full power."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_START_1,"That taunter has Evade. If we're not careful, we'll miss our attacks!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_WAVE2_0,Super reversal! Now I have Deflect!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_WAVE2_1,"By my calculations, I can shrug off 25% of their next attack!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_END_0,"Go on without me, I need to make some repairs."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_04_END_1,Whoever is the mastermind behind this won't go down easily.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_START_0,Don't worry! I have this all under control!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_WAVE2_0,Maybe that was a lie.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_WAVE2_1,Looks like he's going to give his allies the status effect Regeneration!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_WAVE2_2,They'll heal a portion of their health on their next turn.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_END_0,"Doc Ock might have slipped away, but we got his buddies."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_END_1,One of them is bound to give him up.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_END_2,Don't let it get you down. You did one heck of a good job today!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_SPIDERVILLAINS_05_END_3,We'll let you know when we have more information on his plans and whereabouts.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_INTRO_0,SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT INCOMING:
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_INTRO_1,PLEASE REPORT TO THE X-MANSION FOR SPECIAL TRAINING!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_INTRO_2,We heard about what you did in Hell's Kitchen. Nice work!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_INTRO_3,You've been cleared for additional training with the Xtreme X-Men.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_START_0,"Firs' up, cher, y'all gonna get a lesson from Remy LeBeau."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_START_1,"Attacks can have all kindsa different targets, y'know?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_START_2,Ma Basic attack targets one enemy and their most injured ally.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_START_3,Ma Special hits the primary target and any o' their nearby allies.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_START_4,"And ma Ultimate don' leave no enemy free from ma wrath, mon cher."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_END_0,"Now, keep what Gambit showed ya in mind when ya decided how to set up your team."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_01_END_1,"You good to move onto the next session, cher."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_02_START_0,Some enemies will counter-attack if the conditions are met.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_02_START_1,Colossus will counter-attack as long as he has those Charge counters
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_02_START_2,And the S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers will counter-attack when one of their adjacent allies is attacked.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_02_START_3,Use this information and plan your attack accordingly.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_02_END_0,"Good work, team. Nightcrawler will take you through the next lesson."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_03_START_0,"Hey there, newbies! Ant-Man and his friends have agreed to spar with you."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_03_START_1,"That Ability Block effect will stop you from using your Special and Ultimate attacks. Nifty, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_03_WAVE2_0,"My Special will stun my target, leaving them unable to act on their next turn."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_03_WAVE3_0,"My Ultimate will leave your team blinded. Unless you're Daredevil, you'll be missing your next attack."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_03_END_0,"Seems like you have the gist of it. Sunspot is waiting for you, when you're ready to continue training."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_04_START_0,We got some Doom bots you'll train against next. They'll have a chance to inflict Disrupt on your characters.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_04_START_1,"If that happens, that character won't be able to gain positive status effects."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_04_WAVE2_0,Ebony Maw has Immunity. That will keep him from gaining any negative status effects.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_04_END_0,Next up you'll be training with Forge.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_START_0,Let's make this quick. Someone's here to see Storm and I don't trust them.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_START_1,Adam Warlock applied Safeguard to himself and Gamora.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_START_2,We won't be able to flip or remove their positive status effects.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_WAVE2_0,Omega Red can inflict Trauma with his Special.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_WAVE2_1,"If you're hit with that, you won't be able to remove any negative status effects."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_END_0,"While you were busy with that, Storm sent a message."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_XTXM_05_END_1,You'll be joining us on a joint mission with... Magneto.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_0,Strange. Where are we?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_1,You were out in space wandering around hoping for an answer.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_2,I'm bringing you to someone who will help... focus your search.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_3,You better not be wasting my time.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_4,"Time, much like one's mind, is a tool."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_5,And your mind has quite the wear on it.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_INTRO_6,"No pokin' 'round in there, bub."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_START_0,"It seems there is much weighing on your mind, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_WAVE2_0,Your grip on the past may serve you yet.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_END_0,Quit diggin' around in there.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_END_1,"Yer makin' my claws real itchy, lady."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_END_2,"Your scars are deep, despite your healing factor. But so are your bonds."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_01_END_3,"Mutants are a rarity here, but we may be able to contact one here who can help."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_0,How'd you know I need help?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_1,Just look at you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_2,There's but one question on your mind at present...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_3,"...""Where is Charles?"""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_4,I coulda told ya that.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_INTRO_5,You need to attune with the Astral Plane if we're to find 'her'.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_02_START_0,You're being distracted by the ghosts of your past. Focus.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_03_START_0,This is what you call focused?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_03_START_1,"I call it ""workin' through some rage."""
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_04_START_0,Your rage has clouded your path for years.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_04_START_1,And it will continue to obscure the one ahead of you.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_05_START_0,I can see it now. What a brilliant shine.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ANCIENTONE_05_END_0,Come now. Your ally is waiting.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_0,Is this the mirror dimension?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_1,It's a reflection of her.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_2,Emma Frost. Ya brought me to Emma Frost?!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_3,Do you know of any other mutants here with extraordinary telepathy?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_4,Wolverine.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_5,"No time for idle chattin', Frost."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_6,I need ya to help me track down Chuck.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_INTRO_7,"I'd love to be of help to you, but I've got problems of my own to deal with."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_END_0,"Spill it, Frost. What's goin' on?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_END_1,Someone's been poking around in my head.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_01_END_2,"I know my mind best, and something isn't right."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_02_INTRO_0,"I wasn't able to tell what was wrong, but I felt it."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_02_INTRO_1,I knew I had to train and become stronger so I could nail down the source.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_02_INTRO_2,"But you mentioned ""Charles,"" should I know the name?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_02_INTRO_3,"This has gotta be bad news if he was wiped from your memory, too."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_02_START_0,"Fill me in later. For now, let's clear up the riffraff."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_INTRO_0,"If what you're saying is true, mutants everywhere could be at risk."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_INTRO_1,This level of power... It's not unheard of.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_INTRO_2,But you will need my help.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_START_0,Ugh. Let's clear these guys out first.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_END_0,Let me see if he's stashed away somewhere.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_END_1,Hm.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_END_2,What is it?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_03_END_3,A... shadow?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_04_START_0,Why do I feel like we just kicked a hornet's nest?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_05_END_0,This isn't right...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_05_END_1,We're actively being targeted now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_05_END_2,Unless...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_EMMAFROST_05_END_3,That's no ordinary shadow...
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_0,YOU!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_1,Surprised to see the Shadow King?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_2,Who else could have the telepathic skill to affect the minds of millions?
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_3,"Too bad ya forgot about me, Farouk."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_4,"Yes, well, I can hardly be blamed for missing one little lost lamb from another world."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_INTRO_5,But I can rectify that mistake. Right. Now.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_START_0,"Afraid I can't let you dismantle Logan, darling. You messed with my mind as well, and that simply won't do."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_01_START_1,Fine. Let's see if your mind is strong enough to handle my grunts!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_02_START_0,"Get to talkin', bub. Where's Chuck?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_02_START_1,"Why, whoever could you be talking about? Hahahah."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_03_START_0,An illusion! We can't let him get away.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_03_START_1,"Charles put up quite the fight, too."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_03_START_2,"But you know how that goes. Oh, wait. You don't!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_START_0,"You don't seriously think you can beat me, do you?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_START_1,"You're outmatched, out-gunned, out BRAINED!"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_0,"Such a primitive mind. I could shatter it in an instant. But better to leave you broken, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_1,Farouk! Get back here!
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_2,Do not despair. He hasn't escaped far.
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_3,"Shadow King is a formidable enemy, but he no longer has the element of surprise."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_4,"We know who sits at the center of your mystery, Logan."
ID_DIALOG_SSE_ASTRALTEAM_05_END_5,And we WILL get Shadow King to tell us what he's done with Charles Xavier!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Barton, we've had a breach in S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module XR-847B."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,"You're the closest agent to the scene of the incident. Find out how they got in, and why."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,On it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,Stark is not gonna be happy about this...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,Not gonna be happy about what? Did Pepper invite you over for dinner despite my objections?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"You know my feelings about things like this. Work-life balance, boundaries."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,I need time away from your eye-patch now and then.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,A containment module just got cleaned out by some Dark Watch mercs.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"The module was storing the Mask of Ogun, an ancient Kree Monolith, and... "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_9,"I know you like your secrets, Director, but come on. Circle of trust, here. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_10,Your retired Mark VII armor was in it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_11,You lost my super suit? \nThis is why I didn't give my suits to the government in the first place.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_12,"Strange that the GPS tracker didn't activate. Suiting up now. I'll handle it. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_13,"Thanks for the offer, Stark, but Barton's team is already on it."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_INTRO_14,I wasn't offering. \nTell Clint I'll be there in five.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_0,I've got eyes on the perps. Looks like a surgical raid.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_1,"They knew what they were looking for. Trucks are already loaded up and rolling out. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_2,"So, S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks it can catch up with us? Too bad, too slow."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_3,Let's see what kind of damage a remote-controlled Iron Man suit can do. Switch that thing on!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_START_4,Bring it on. I could use the exercise.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_MID_0,"They ACTIVATED my suit, too? Okay, now I'm upset. I set up the security protocol on that module personally."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_MID_1,"Tony, as long as you don't start turning green on me, I'm good with you fighting angry."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_0,"Took care of these guys pretty quickly. Thankfully, I might even be able to salvage that suit."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_1,"Sentimental value, you know?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_2,"That's nice, Tony, \nbut those guys made off with the Mask of Ogun and that Kree Monolith before we got here."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_3,"Mercs have no use for artifacts like those. We need to find out what they plan to do with them. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_01_END_4,"Count me in. I want to know who hacked my systems, and then I want to bring them down a peg."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,"Daisy, Tony and I are in pursuit of the mercenaries."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,Any chatter out there on the dark web linked to our missing cargo?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,Search algorithms have flagged a meeting on a rooftop in Hell's Kitchen. Starts in fifteen minutes.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,Who's on the guest list? What's the planned entertainment for the evening?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,"Mercenaries, Hand Ninjas, and the Mask of Ogun. It's gonna be a blast."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_INTRO_5,"That's the idea... right after I bombard them with a salvo of micro rockets. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_0,"Look, this thing is hot, and we need to move it right now. Do you want the mask or not?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_1,You fools... You were followed!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_2,I expect a heavy discount for your carelessness. Koroshite yaru!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_START_3,"Clint, maybe we should just sit back and watch them insult each other to death. No? Fine, let's smoke 'em."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_0,"You think stopping us here means anything? You know nothing, Stark."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_1,"Oh yeah? Then fill me in, cupcake, before I laser beam you where the sun don't shine."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_02_END_2,The Legion cannot be stopped. Humanity is theirs for the taking...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Got my suit back, got the mask, what's next on our scavenger hunt?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,That ancient Kree Monolith.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,"Right, right. Mr. Soldier of Fortune back there mentioned something about ""The Legion."" Any idea what he's talking about?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,Alpha Flight records link the phrase to a Kree rogue faction called the Lunatic Legion.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,"In the wake of Ultimus's invasion, these guys have been working to recover ancient Kree relics all over the world."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_5,So they're a bunch of evil blue Indiana Joneses? Noted.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_6,"Clint, time to bring the fight to these mercs' doorstep. We got a read on their safehouse yet?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_7,Affirmative. They work out of an abandoned Hydra armory.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_INTRO_8,Of course they do.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_0,"Humans, prove yourselves worthy of the gifts you have been given."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_1,Defeat these fools from S.H.I.E.L.D. and earn your place within the Legion.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_2,Looks like we know who wears the pants in this crew.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_START_3,Have fun taking out the mercs. I've got the blue one.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_0,"Tony, you seeing what I'm seeing? These mercs have blue patches of skin."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_1,That better not be contagious.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_2,"Hard to say, but it looks like it's spreading across this guy's whole body."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_3,"Hey Smurfette, you wanna tell us what's going on here with your happy little army of blue-ish mooks?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_4,"I speak for my master, Kona Lor. We are the Lunatic Legion."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_5,"If you are looking for the Monolith, it is now back in the hands of true Kree believers thanks to aid from Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_6,Salvation will soon be at hand for all humans that are deemed worthy.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_7,"So, a group of Kree fanatics want to cleanse the Earth of humanity? And you're working for Ultimus?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_8,"Couldn't think of anything more original, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_9,"What, you're not gonna carve the Monolith into a statue of Ronan and present it as a wedding gift to the Supreme Intelligence?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_03_END_10,I gotta say... I'm a LITTLE disappointed right now.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Agent Johnson, where are we with the analysis on those mercs with the blue skin?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"Tony, we've brought in our very best S.H.I.E.L.D. Medic to run tests on the subjects."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_2,"I'll patch you through. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_3,"Mr. Stark, analysis of the subjects recovered at the armory shows a new form of Terrigenesis in their systems."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_4,So the Lunatic Legion is turning humans into Inhumans?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_5,No. This is more comprehensive. The process changes the genetic code of someone and makes them into a full-blooded Kree.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_6,And taking control of the Kree Monolith gives them access to a massive cache of Terrigen...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_7,which could make this thing at risk of going global.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_8,"Daisy, have you been able to track down the Monolith yet?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_9,I've been scanning the surface of the moon since the Lunatic Legion has been known to operate from there in the past.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_10,It appears a transmission was in fact sent from the armory to the Blue Area of the Moon just before we raided it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_11,"Hey Clint, ever wanted to go take a walk on the moon?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_12,Walk? Not so much.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_INTRO_13,Always wanted to know how far I could shoot an arrow from there.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_START_0,"Tony, you notice how all these Kree zealots aren't even corrupted?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_START_1,"I guess it's easy to declare loyalty to a guy like Ultimus, who hates humans as much as they do."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_0,A corrupted Yondu? Here? Don't these guys know he's Centaurian and not Kree?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_1,"Shows how much you know, tin man. They MADE me into a Kree."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_MID_2,Full-blooded and everything. Now I'm stronger than ever!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_END_0,"You fools. With the Terrigen Crystals in our hands, there's nothing you can do to stop the Grand Design."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_04_END_1,"Oh, they even have a special name for their terrifying ritual. Nice."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but that lab up ahead sure as heck looks like an A.I.M. lab."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,I should have bought that company and fired them all when I had the chance.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,Who else would happily make an atmospheric bomb that gives people a case of the Kreebie-Jeebies for a bunch of zealots?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,Because science.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_0,Tony! How nice to see you!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_1,"Check it out, my very own moon base. What do you think?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_2,"Listen up, Nacho Supreme."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_3,"Put down the beakers, turn off the Bunsen burners, and hand over your science fair project."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_4,"Oh, please. You can't seriously be angry with me?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_START_5,Everybody needs a little side hustle!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_0,"Ok, playtime's over. Cough it up, Craziness Supreme."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_1,I'm sorry to inform you that you arrived here too late.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_2,The Lunatic Legion has already taken the Terrigen Bomb to their warship.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_3,Give me one good reason I shouldn't quarantine you in that airlock.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_4,"There's no need for ill manners, \nMr. Stark. It's just science. "
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_5,Take this vaccine with you. It will likely nullify the cocktail within the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_6,Hold up... you made a vaccine for a weapon that you gave to Ultimus's cronies?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_7,What kind of a scientist engineers a plague without making a vaccine? \nDo you think I'm insane?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_8,...
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_05_END_9,...just hand it over.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,"Alright, team, no more messing around."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,Time to hit 'em where it hurts.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,"Clint, we've got a Kree warship to assault and a bomb to disable."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Roger that, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_0,"Team, we have orders to keep these guys from the bridge. Make it so."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_1,"Huh. Well, now I know how they breached my security protocols."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_START_2,"Friday, make a note to update all my logins to use eight-factor authentication."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_END_0,"Stark, you need to hurry. The ship is approaching Earth's atmosphere."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_06_END_1,Working on it.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_0,Friday is telling me that there is a squad of corrupted Avengers protecting the bomb up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_1,Ready for a doppelganger fight?
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_INTRO_2,Wouldn't have it any other way.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_0,"Hey everybody, look! It's Tony Stark, the big brave hero, and he's come to save the day!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_1,"Hah! That guy is a dead ringer for you, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_START_2,"Oh please, I do not sound like that. Wait. Do I?"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_0,Not good. They've set the ship on a crash course for the Pacific Ocean.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_1,"Tony, get that vaccine into the bomb's viral release cannister before we hit atmo!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_2,Way ahead of you.
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_3,Just a twist to the left... and... it's locked in!
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_4,"It's done. There's nothing else we can do for this ship, time to get out of Dodge!"
ID_DIALOG_IRONMAN_EVENT_07_END_5,"Hang on tight, Hawkeye. I'll fly you out of here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_0,"Captain Quill, I've got a task that you and your Cosmic allies might be able to help S.T.R.I.K.E. with."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_1,Ultimus is testing a hybrid Odium serum on his soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_2,It makes them enraged with super strength but with none of the usual weaknesses.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_3,"As in, the Odium doesn't eventually kill them after taking it?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_4,Exactly.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_5,That sucks.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_INTRO_6,I'll pull the crew together.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_0,"Hey Korath, back away from the Odium...\nOr else. Cuz Star-Lord's here!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_1,WHO?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_START_2,"You know what, every Korath I come across says that. Not cool, bro."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_END_0,And THAT'S what happens when you mess with the Guardians... and Ravagers... of S.T.R.I.K.E.!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_01_END_1,I definitely thought that would sound better.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_0,What's the deal with Odium anyway? Why would people drink something like that?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_1,"In Kree culture, when a soldier is outnumbered without hope of surviving, they drink Odium."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_2,"All strength, no pain. A fearsome last stand. A fitting end for a warrior seeking glory."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_3,That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Who the heck kills themselves over something like that?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_4,Typical Kree Noble nonsense.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_5,"If it would help protect any of you, I would do it without hesitation."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_INTRO_6,"Dang it, Gamora, why'd you gotta go and say that? You're gonna make me all weepy, you jerk!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_0,"This Odium supply belongs to Ultimus. Leave this place, or you will be destroyed."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_1,Do you have tickets yet?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_2,"Umm, to what?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_START_3,To the gun show! Pew pew pew!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_END_0,"Two supply lines down, a whole buttload more to go."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_02_END_1,Good. Then there is only a small amount remaining.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_0,"Listen up, Robocop. Turn over the Odium and... that giant pile of high-tech assault weapons."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_1,Or what?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_2,"Or... We're gonna have a gunfight. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_START_3,Works for me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_0,Hi there! You're all trespassing on sacred land belonging to Ultimus. Prepare to die!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_1,Hasselhofftopia remembers!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_MID_2,This is my nightmare.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_03_END_0,That... was... AWESOME!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_START_0,This latest Odium formula is my greatest achievement.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_START_1,Ultimus WILL have it. We cannot be stopped!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_0,"I swear, EVERY time science goes bad, SHE is ALWAYS there."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_1,Tell me about it. I'm just happy corrupted versions of YOU aren't running the show.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_04_END_2,"Yeah, you'd all be screwed if that ever happened."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_0,"Finally, the ultimate test of my strength. If I die today, I know I will have been bested by my superior."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_1,You are a wise and handsome man.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_2,As are you.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_START_3,Can we PLEASE just start fighting already?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_END_0,I am GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_05_END_1,Without a doubt! Now all we have to do is find that Odium factory.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_0,Huh. Looks like Ultimus sent Loki to stop us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_1,You think he'll give a villainous monologue and tell us where Ultimus's Odium factory is located?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_2,"Ah, the infamous Star-Lord honors us with his presence."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_3,"And his illustrious band of misfits, oh this keeps getting better and better..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_4,"Tell you what... You will all be dead soon, so I suppose it doesn't matter."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_5,The Odium factory is housed on a Kree warship in orbit around planet Berhert.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_START_6,Um... Thanks?
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_END_0,"Rocket, put in the coordinates for Berhert. Let's end this."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_06_END_1,On it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_0,That corrupted Loki never mentioned ANYTHING about a corrupted Ultimus AND Thanos guarding the Odium factory.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_1,"Well, Peter, that fella was a snake. Seems par for the course to me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_START_2,"Good talk, Yondu. Good talk."
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_0,BOOYAH!
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_1,No more Odium for Ultimus! I bet he's gonna cry like a big blue baby.
ID_DIALOG_LE_STARLORD_07_END_2,Fury's gonna love hearing about this...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_0,"Thanks to Nick Fury, we have tracked down nearly all the components necessary to resurrect the Supreme Intelligence."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_1,All the more concerning that he's gone missing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_2,What do you mean? Has Ultimus captured him again?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_3,Unknown. Last contact with Fury was behind enemy lines on planet Kallu.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_4,That area is way too hot for a S.T.R.I.K.E. team. We'd never make it in one piece.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_5,The Kree resistance will find him. Our minions can infiltrate enemy lines without risk of exposure.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_INTRO_6,"It is our duty to track down Fury. Without him, the Supreme Intelligence cannot be brought back online."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_START_0,Fury landed here on Kallu. We must follow the trail to his last known location.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_START_1,After we rid this planet of these corrupted Ravagers...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_END_0,"Excellent work, team. Your reputations precede you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_01_END_1,Stop acting like you're running this squad just because you have a cape.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_0,Do we know yet where Fury's trail ends?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_1,Up ahead. Fury's tracks lead into that research facility on the ridge.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_2,Scans indicate a heavy presence of Hydra soldiers guarding the lab.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_INTRO_3,Time to expel them from one of our worlds. Permanently.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_0,"Kree soldiers, you do not have the proper clearance to enter this facility."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_1,"Return to your assigned patrol duties, immediately."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_START_2,You dare give orders to a Kree? Prepare to taste our wrath.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_0,Do we know why Fury came to this facility?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_1,"It appears this facility was once run by one of our most-renowned scientists, Zara-Lar."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_02_END_2,Perhaps he believes she can help bring back the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_0,Those Hydra fools were so weak that we did not even need to use our Odium! Disappointing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_1,Your words strike true. We can only hope our future adversaries are worthy.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_2,Records in the lab indicate that Fury surrendered without a fight and was taken to a Kree Warship for processing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_3,That is odd. I would have expected him to fell a dozen Hydra scum before capture.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_4,We must assault one of Ultimus's Kree Warships in orbit to learn more.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_INTRO_5,Details of Fury's current location will be found in the ship's receiving logs.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_0,Wait... You do NOT have the proper clearance codes to board this vessel!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_1,And you do not have the will to serve the true Kree Empire.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_START_2,Prepare for judgment.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_0,What do the ship's records say about Fury?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_1,He has been taken to Berhert. Ultimus has established a highly fortified prison there.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_03_END_2,Then to Berhert we shall go. Saving Fury gives us hope to revive the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_0,Do we have a path ahead to the prison mapped out?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_1,Scans indicate that Ultimus has stationed S.H.I.E.L.D. patrols throughout the area.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_2,He has S.H.I.E.L.D. forces out here?\nOn Berhert?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_INTRO_3,Affirmative. This planet holds his maximum security prison. Retrieving Nick Fury from there will be difficult.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_START_0,A S.H.I.E.L.D. patrol has spotted us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_START_1,Not a concern. All I see are more heathens to reduce to ash.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_END_0,"Send word to Ronan. If we are to break Fury out of the prison, we need additional Kree support."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_04_END_1,Agreed. I believe there is an optimal choice for the task...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_0,The team's efforts thus far have been admirable.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_1,"You honor us, but we have more battles to win."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_2,Nick Fury's cell is heavily guarded by corrupted mercenaries in the prison.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_3,"To make matters worse, he is scheduled for conversion within hours."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_4,We cannot fight our way to his cell in time. I propose an alternative approach.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_5,Have Ard-Con pose as Ultimus to get us to Nick Fury's cell with minimal resistance.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_6,"Ard-Con, are you up to the task?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_INTRO_7,"It is but one step on the road to my revenge. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_0,"Hi there, Ultimus. Would you kindly give me the secret password so I don't have to stab-shoot you for being an imposter?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_1,"The password is... ""step aside or I will rip you in half."""
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_START_2,"Incorrect. Prepare for the end, imposter!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_0,"Someone sounded the general alarm, and your eyes aren't glowing."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_1,I figure you're here to set me free.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_2,Indeed.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_3,Good to see y'all. Though we can't leave here just yet.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_4,You want to bring back the Supreme Intelligence? Can't do it without saving a Kree scientist named Zara-Lar.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_05_END_5,"Lucky for you, she's here in this prison."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_0,The whole reason I'm in this prison is because I was searching for Zara-Lar.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_1,The Kree scientist who is the final key to resurrecting the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_2,"When I discovered she'd been taken here, Ultimus's forces were closing in on me and I couldn't risk broadcasting the message to you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_3,So you let them capture you with the intent of confirming she was here?
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_4,"Reckless, but bold.\nYour reputation is well earned. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_5,I'm just glad you guys were able to track me down in time.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_INTRO_6,Let's save Zara-Lar and get out of here before Ultimus gets wind of this.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_START_0,"Halt, prisoner! Fury's out of his cage. Contact the warden!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_START_1,"No time to mess around here, team. Put 'em down quickly so we can get Zara-Lar out."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_END_0,"Zara-Lar, we're here to free you. Ready to bring back the Supreme Intelligence?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_06_END_1,Backing up the Supreme Intelligence in case of catastrophe is my life's work.\nOf course.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_0,"It is quite impressive how much progress you've made in your efforts to resurrect the Supreme Intelligence, human."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_1,"Ultimus is our mutual enemy. We only defeat him as allies. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_2,"The data cores were impounded when I was captured. All of the components required are here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_3,I just need time to bring the system online and upload my primary boot sequence to reference the backup archives of the elders.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INTRO_4,"We've got your back, but Ultimus has to have gotten wind of our plans by now. Expect heavy resistance forces to intercept."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_0,You dare to revive this false Kree idol? Ultimus is the one and true god of all.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_1,"As protector of the Kree resistance, I vow to annihilate you and all corrupted in tribute."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_START_2,For the Kree!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_1_0,Preparing initial boot sequence of the Supreme Intelligence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_2_0,All systems are green. Upload of archived elders activated.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_3_0,It's nearly done. Resurrection sequence initiated!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_FAIL_0,"We have failed, Zara-Lar. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_0,The Supreme Intelligence is back online! We've done it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_1,Good. We finally have the tactical advantage we need to take down Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_2,Begin the process of searching for the optimal strategy to defeat him.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_3,Search initiated.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_4,"The Supreme Intelligence will remember what you've done, Nick Fury. Be sure of that."
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_5,Here's hoping. I almost got converted looking for a way to help save it...
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_6,Transfer the Supreme Intelligence to the Space Force destroyer.
ID_DIALOG_LE_NICKFURY_07_END_7,I will ensure that they safely reach my stronghold.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_0,Magneto... to say it's a surprise to see you would be an understatement.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_1,Why are you here?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_2,"Ororo, the Brotherhood of Mutants requires your help. For the sake of all mutant-kind."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_3,"Ok, I'm listening."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_4,"When we started this war with Ultimus, I hid Asteroid M\nsomewhere safe. Somewhere that no one would find it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_5,"Unfortunately, it seems that\nAsteroid M has gone missing."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_6,My connection to the asteroid has somehow become severed. I can no longer sense its presence.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_7,"If I help you find it, what's in it for us? For S.T.R.I.K.E.?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_8,"If you help me recover Asteroid M,\nI vow to unleash my wrath on Ultimus... on your terms."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_INTRO_9,S.T.R.I.K.E. can work with that.\nI'll gather the team.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_START_0,"Magneto, why the docks?\nWhat's your angle?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_START_1,"First, clear away this rabble, Logan.\nThen you will see."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_END_0,"If we are to find Asteroid M, we must first procure the right form of transportation."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_END_1,"A submarine, in this case."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_01_END_2,"You never make things easy, Magneto.  "
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_0,A Hydra submarine will get us to our destination efficiently.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_1,Why a Hydra submarine?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_2,I suspected you would be more comfortable with this than stealing a submarine from S.H.I.E.L.D. forces.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_3,Plus--
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_4,Nazis?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_INTRO_5,Nazis.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_START_0,"Listen up, Hydra flunkies!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_START_1,Give us your sub or Magneto's gonna start pushing coins into your brains like a kid abandoned by his parents at an arcade.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_START_2,"Too soon, boss?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_END_0,I never tire of toying with these lesser beings.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_END_1,"Enough. We're here for the submarine,\nthat's all."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_02_END_2,Indeed. All aboard.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_0,Why the Mariana Trench?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_1,It's the deepest known place on Earth. A place even Ultimus would never notice it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_2,Or so I had hoped.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_3,"Mystique, how much longer until we're there?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_4,"The sub is holding together,\nbut we've got problems."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_5,Someone is messing with my controls. It's coming from the engine room.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_INTRO_6,"Time to eliminate the stowaway. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_START_0,Surrender now or we will sink this submarine permanently.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_START_1,Not a chance. You will fail just as all of Ultimus's peons have.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_END_0,Helm controls have been restored.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_03_END_1,I'm sensing trace amounts of Gravitonium in the area. That's not right...
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_0,"Magneto, what's going on here?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_1,"It's quite simple, really. Ultimus must have discovered Asteroid M and encased it in a shell of Gravitonium to move it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_2,"A corrupted Quake, I imagine.\nShe must be quite powerful\nto manage that."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_3,A worthy adversary.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_4,That can't be good.\nAre we too late to stop him?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_5,That much gravitonium leaves a lingering trail. I can sense it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_INTRO_6,It leads to the southern coast of Japan. We will find out more there.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_START_0,"For Hydra filth, you certainly are persistent."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_START_1,"You cannot steal from us without consequences, Magneto."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_START_2,We will have our revenge.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_START_3,But that is exactly what I did. And now YOU will pay the price. Again.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_END_0,Those guys are always such a useless bunch of knuckleheads.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_END_1,"On the contrary, Marko,\ntheir purpose is quite clear."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_04_END_2,They simply lack the ability to stand up to our kind. Strength conquers all.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_INTRO_0,It appears that Asteroid M passed through here and laid waste\nto the city up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_INTRO_1,Such are the losses of war.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_INTRO_2,The fallen can be avenged once we retake the asteroid.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_INTRO_3,"If Ultimus gains full control of it\nin orbit, there's no telling what\nhe might do with it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_START_0,Alpha Flight has a space launch facility nearby in Tanegashima.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_START_1,If we can fight past these corrupted we can attempt to intercept the asteroid before it reaches orbit.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_START_2,"Very well. We will cut a swathe through the ranks of the First Legion and\nhave our starship. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_END_0,We must hurry. We cannot risk Ultimus gaining full control of Asteroid M.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_05_END_1,Preparing for launch to Alpha Flight Station. Stand by.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_INTRO_0,"Raven, now would be an opportune time for you to infiltrate Alpha Flight station discreetly."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_INTRO_1,"The less warning they have to our presence, the greater our chances of taking control of Asteroid M quickly."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_INTRO_2,Works for me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_INTRO_3,"Besides, impersonating a Kree guard is easy for me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_INTRO_4,It'll be nice to stay blue for a change.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_START_0,I'm here for a routine maintenance check. Orders straight from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_START_1,I AM GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_START_2,Fine! We'll do this the hard way!
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_END_0,"Engineering deck secured, but I'm not sure it's going to help us any."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_END_1,How so?
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_END_2,Looks like Ultimus has strapped a bunch of rocket boosters onto Asteroid M.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_06_END_3,The rockets are preparing for launch in the main control room. We need to get there now.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_0,"If Ultimus gets those rockets going on Asteroid M, corrupted Quake will devastate what's left of Earth's defense forces."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_1,And just as we were starting to rally...
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_2,"I can help delay the inevitable, but this effort will require all of us mutants banding together to stop Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_3,We will all do our part.\nToo much is at stake.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_4,It is unfortunate that a threat as terrible as Ultimus was what it took to bring us all together.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_5,It takes the strength of unity to face an evil as great as this.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_6,"Don't forget your promise, Magneto. Once this is over, you do things\nby the book."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INTRO_7,In due time.\nWe have a great challenge before us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_START_0,You can't stop us. Ultimus will have his victory.  I'll make sure of that.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_START_1,"I sense great power within you, Quake.\nBut you are just a pawn for a weak creature."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_START_2,"And without you, your Operators will not be able to complete their task."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_1_0,Focus on taking Quake down. Before those Operators can fire up the engines.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_2_0,"Asteroid M's rockets are all online, boot up sequence complete."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_3_0,The Operators are almost done activating the rockets. Take down Quake. Hurry!
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 stages complete.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_FAIL_0,You are too late. There's no way to stop Asteroid M now. Your forces are doomed!
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_0,Quake's down.\nWe got this thing in the bag.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_1,"Indeed. Try as they might, those rockets will not stop me now."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_2,Asteroid M is once again mine.
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_3,"And with control of it, I can re-focus my efforts on humiliating Ultimus and his forces on Nexus Earth once again."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_4,"By coordinating through S.T.R.I.K.E.,\nof course. As you promised."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_5,"Ororo, when I make a promise,\nI keep it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_MAGNETO_07_END_6,"Until the environment changes again, of course. You understand."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_0,"Fury, Ultimus has launched a new attack on my country."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_1,"He seeks to destroy the gates and cut us off from our allies. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_2,We put the Hellicarrier portals in Wakanda because you're supposed to be able to handle this kind of thing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_3,"Our defenses are holding, but his forces are attacking with a new ferocity. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_4,My instruments are picking up a presence beyond the normal corruption...
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_5,It's a biological element enhancing their power. Something symbiotic.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_6,Hold tight. I'm sending someone with expertise in that particular field.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INTRO_7,Just once I wish someone wanted me for my expertise on the best pizza in New York.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_START_0,THE WAKANDANS ARE A POWERFUL GROUP THAT EXCEL WHEN THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_START_1,SHURI PROVIDES SUPPORT VIA DEFENSE AND HEALING TO HER FELLOW TEAMMATES.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_START_2,"IF WAKANDANS ARE ON THE FIELD, SHE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH <color=#FFF568>CHARGE</color>."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_MID_0,"What's up, cousins?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_MID_1,Killmonger. Even in other dimensions you're a rabid dog.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INFO_01_0,OKOYE IS A FIERCE WARRIOR THAT CAN ASSIST HER FELLOW WAKANDANS WHEN SHE IS CHARGED.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_INFO_01_1,OKOYE'S <color=#FFF568>BASIC ABILITY</color> HAS A CHANCE TO REMOVE A POSITIVE EFFECT FROM AN ENEMY.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_END_0,Oh no. Ultimus isn't using cells from just any Symbiote to power these troops. He's using Carnage!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_END_1,How can we stop it?
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_END_2,"Theoretically, if we got our hands on our own Carnage Symbiote, I could synthesize an anti-serum. But we'd have to find him first."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_01_END_3,"If he's that important, Ultimus will be hunting him as well. You'll need my help."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_INTRO_0,Target acquired. Moving in on Carnage now.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_INTRO_1,"You meatbags think you can get the drop on us, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_INTRO_2,Let's see what your fancy uniforms look like once they're torn to shreds.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_INTRO_3,I can't believe this is the guy we have to save.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_START_0,"Spider-sap! Hang tight, we'll slice and dice you as soon as we're through with them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_START_1,"Oh, and you brought a friend for us to play with!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_START_2,"Ugh, are all of your enemies so ridiculous?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_START_3,"Shocker's funny, but not in a ""laughing with him"" way."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_START_4,DEFEAT THE <color=#fff568>ENEMY OPERATORS</color> BEFORE THEY KIDNAP CARNAGE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_0,"1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_1_1,"If the Operators open that portal, they'll escape with Carnage!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_0,"2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_2_1,Their portal is halfway open!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_0,"3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_3_1,We need to stop the Operators! Their portal is almost open!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_4_0,"4 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_PORTAL_ACTIVATED_4_1,"They've opened the portal and taken Carnage. We're too late... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_END_0,These pathetic dime-store knock-offs are an embarrassment!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_END_1,"As soon as we find this Ultimus guy, we're going to rip him to a thousand pieces for making us look bad."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_02_END_2,I think this hideous goop monster just agreed to help us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_0,"Okay, I compared the corrupted Symbiote cells to our Carnage's cells."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_1,There's some technological component in there though... I can't tell what it is.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_2,It's from Ultimus's Conversion Engine. I've never seen it firsthand before.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_3,Can you shut it down?
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_4,"Of course I can. I said I've never seen it before, not that I didn't understand it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_INTRO_5,"If you get me to the device creating these monsters, I can reverse engineer it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_START_0,A massive building in the middle of the Arctic. This must be the place.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_START_1,The facility is here. We can sense it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_START_2,The army of Carnage-powered guards was also a subtle hint.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_END_0,"Shuri, have you noticed anything weird about this round of Ultimus's twerps?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_END_1,The amount of strength they're displaying - that energy output needed cannot be sustained. They're burning out.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_END_2,We're too much power for these chumps!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_END_3,"The Conversion Engine weakens the willpower of anyone it corrupts. That's how we've been able to fend off the army of Ultimus so far. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_03_END_4,"With the Symbiote's will corrupted, both the host and the Symbiote eventually become too weak to survive. It's a death spiral. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_INTRO_0,"My Kimoyo beads are scanning the facility. There are massive lifesigns in the next room. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_INTRO_1,Hello! I am Mantis. Nice to meet you! Prepare to die.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_INTRO_2,"Sorry, did no one tell you? All insect and arachnid themed heroes are on ""Team S.T.R.I.K.E."" now. So, you can just let us go."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_INTRO_3,I sense humor! Masking great sadness.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_INTRO_4,"Oh, I'll give him something to be sad about..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_START_0,This oddly friendly Mantis woman is coaxing the Symbiotes into undergoing Ultimus's experiments.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_START_1,"If we stop her, no more Symbiotes will be forced to join Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_END_0,"I spent most of my life in Wakanda, and now I am in the Arctic surrounded by aliens."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_END_1,"Yeah, sorry about that. Occupational hazard."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_04_END_2,Are you joking? This is the coolest day of my life!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_0,"This looks like a modified Conversion Engine. There's a canister for containing raw Symbiotes. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_1,I'll scan it for analysis. That will help my team back at Mount Bashenga reverse the effects.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_2,If I can just adjust the circuits controlling beta particle flow...
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_3,Then I'll be able to shut down the nanospore sequencing...
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_4,And we can disable this irritating device for good!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_5,"You know, Your Highness, we make a pretty good team."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_INTRO_6,"Enough! If we don't get to shred something soon, we're going to join Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_0,Princess! I have arrived. Witness as my strength turns the tide!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_1,"Woah, who's this guy?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_2,M'Baku. He's extremely extra.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_3,M'BAKU IS A POWERFUL PROTECTOR THAT GAINS BLOCK CHANCE THE MORE <color=#FFF568>CHARGE</color> HE HAS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_4,"IF A TARGET DODGES M'BAKU'S <color=#FFF568>BASIC ABILITY</color>, M'BAKU WILL GET A BONUS ATTACK."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_START_5,DEFEATING ENEMIES WITH M'BAKU'S <color=#FFF568>ULTIMATE</color> ALLOWS HIM TO CHAIN TO ADJACENT TARGETS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_0,Ha! The machine is down. Sometimes I even impress myself.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_1,"I've got the data needed to make the anti-serum. No more Carnage, finally!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_2,"Uh, present company excepted."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_3,"Oh, you're not getting rid of us! And now that we've dealt with those posers, we can settle our score with you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_4,"Calm down, crazy! S.T.R.I.K.E. already saved your life. We're not going to hurt you now."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_5,"As much as I hate to say it, we still need your help. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_05_END_6,Little sister! Ultimus has launched another assault! I need you to return to Wakanda at once.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_0,"Big brother! Our mission was a success. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_1,You have returned just in time. We are receiving a transmission from Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_2,Ruler of Wakanda! I have allowed your continued existence for too long.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_3,"If you won't bow to my will, my amplified First Legion will take your country - and your portals - for me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_4,You are not the first warlord to try and take my kingdom. You will fail as they did.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_5,Is your anti-serum ready?
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_INTRO_6,I guess we're about to find out.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_START_0,Surrender to the might of Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_START_1,"If we subdue them, we can administer the anti-serum. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_START_2,"If I did the math right then this dose should set off a chain reaction. Free one batch of Carnage Symbiote cells, and their telepathic bond will free them all. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_START_3,Then Ultimus is out of options.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_END_0,Whatever powers the Symbiotes were granting the First Legion are failing them. The anti-serum worked!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_06_END_1,Phew. It was like... a 50/50 shot that was going to work. Maybe 60/40.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_0,"Was that all Ultimus has got? I don't understand, why were all of you so worried about him?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_1,I do not think the fight is over yet.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_2,"You've left me no choice, little panther. I would have added your technology and people to my legions."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_3,But instead... my Pyros will burn it to the ground. So says Ultimus!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_4,Not today! Wakanda forever!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_5,Wakanda forever!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_6,Sorry. I got carried away.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_7,"Everyone gets one. Don't worry, it was only mildly embarrassing. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_INTRO_8,Now let's make Ultimus regret ever coming to Wakanda!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_START_0,Look at all the luscious jungle.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_START_1,Time to turn it to ash!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_START_2,KILLMONGER IS A LETHAL ASSASSIN WHO DRAINS HEALTH FROM ENEMIES AND ELIMINATES WEAKENED TARGETS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_START_3,KILLMONGER'S <color=#FFF568>PASSIVE</color> ALLOWS HIM TO ATTACK THE MOST INJURED ENEMY WHEN HE GAINS <color=#FFF568>DEFENSE UP</color>.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_START_4,THE MORE <color=#FFF568>CHARGE</color> KILLMONGER HAS THE GREATER HIS CRIT CHANCE IS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_FAIL_0,The jungle is burning! Fall back!
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_0,It is over. Wakanda is safe.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_1,"Your Highness. Portals are secure, and Helicarrier reinforcements are pouring in from other dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_2,Ultimus is retreating.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_3,With his tail between his legs.
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_4,"He's out of Symbiotes, we took down his elite First Legion troops...\nI'm beginning to think we might just win this thing."
ID_DIALOG_LE_SHURI_07_END_5,Was there ever any doubt?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_0,Another wave of Ultimus's forces down...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_1,Only 'nother few hundred to go.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_2,My ninja are... regrouping... around the enemy...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_3,"Elektra, you're in no shape to fight. Fall back and rest."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_4,X-Men? Back into battle.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_INTRO_5,"If this is to be our final stand,\nit will be together!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_START_0,"You can't hold out forever, especially now that we have our own mutant firepower."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_START_1,"Prepare to fall, X-Men."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_0,The force from earlier... I can feel it! It's here!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_1,My friends. I've returned.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_2,Jeanie? Where the hell have you been?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_3,"Answers later, Logan. We have a fight to finish."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_4,"PHOENIX IS A POWERFUL CONTROLLER WHO EXCELS AT DEALING DAMAGE, PROTECTING ALLIES, AND CLEARING <color=#fff568>POSITIVE EFFECTS</color> FROM ENEMIES"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_5,"PHOENIX'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>STEALTH</color> AND <color=#fff568>DEFENSE UP</color> TO ALL ALLIES, REDISTRIBUTES HER HEALTH TO ALL ALLIES AND TRANSFERS <color=#fff568>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> FROM THEM TO HERSELF."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_MID_6,"UPON DEATH, PHOENIX'S <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> SUMMONS DARK PHOENIX."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_END_0,"Red, you are a sight for sore eyes."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_END_1,I'm so glad to see all of you. I've been lost for so long.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_01_END_2,"But now I'm home. And I know how to get rid of Ultimus, once and for all."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_0,"As Ultimus ripped holes in the fabric of reality, a shard of the Phoenix Force was torn from me and trapped in another dimension."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_1,"If the Phoenix is trapped, that dimension is a prison even Ultimus can't escape from. But Wanda, I think you can open it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_2,I'll do whatever I can to help end Ultimus. But why me?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_3,You're the guardian of the Nexus and M'Kraan Crystal. We can use the crystal as a key to that dimension.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_4,Guardian? Ha! None of you have the common sense or mystic skill to use that crystal wisely.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_5,"It sounds like you just volunteered to join us, Mordo. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INTRO_6,Ultimus has no idea that he's summoned his own undoing.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_START_0,"Of all the backwater planets we could visit, why Morag?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_START_1,"We're following the crystal to this prison dimension. It led us here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_START_2,"Ey! These weirdos are looking to get in on our score! Ravagers, take 'em out!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_START_3,Locals. And they're restless. Defend yourself!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INFO_01_0,DARK PHOENIX UNLEASHES A TORRENT OF COSMIC FIRE ON HER ENEMIES
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_INFO_01_1,DARK PHOENIX'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> STEALS HEALTH FROM ENEMIES TO HERSELF AND APPLIES <color=#fff568>REGENERATION</color> TO X-MEN ALLIES

ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_END_0,Nothing here! I'm shocked that there's no gateway to another dimension in this disgusting mud pit.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_END_1,"Your optimism is infectious, Mordo. The path forward is here, we just can't traverse it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_END_2,We need a way to move through realities as a group. Any ideas?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_END_3,I think I know someone.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_02_END_4,"Fear not, mi gente. I'm here to help."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_0,"Who are you, exactly?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_1,America Chavez. Your ticket to the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_2,See these muscles? They're not just for show. I punch holes in the universe. Then we go through. Get it?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_3,Can you take us somewhere specific?\nI'm telepathically showing you where.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_4,"Got it. Let me know if you see anything else you like while poking around my head, Red..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_5,"I typically prefer interdimensional magic a bit more precise\nthan ""punch it real hard."""
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INTRO_6,"If this one wants to stay behind, I'm not going to complain. Now, get ready! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_START_0,We're through. How did we end up in an A.I.M. lab?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_START_1,"Realities are strung together like a chain of pearls. This is the one adjacent to the dimension we're trying to access. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_START_2,"Unfortunately, it's one where the Scientist Supreme and A.I.M. have taken over Earth."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_START_3,"Um, excuse you. Scientist Supreme is out. I'm in charge here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_START_4,"And as Spider-Supreme, I'm happy to announce you're all my next test subjects!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_INFO_01_0,AMERICA CHAVEZ IS A MYSTICAL BRAWLER WHO EXCELS AT SINGLE TARGET DAMAGE

ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_END_0,"Hm, first run of trials on my ""destroying heroes"" experiment isn't producing great results."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_END_1,Sorry to hear that. Come closer and I'll show you some results at least one of us will be happy with.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_03_END_2,"Oh, I'm not worried. That was just the control group."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_0,"I can feel the barrier between worlds here. Wanda, can you use the M'Kraan to open the way?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_1,Just give me a moment and we'll be out of h-- AARGH!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_2,The barrier is more powerful than I feared. It's going to take a massive amount of mystic energy to open it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_3,Perhaps I can be of assistance.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_4,Strange?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_5,"This dimension's Doctor Strange, yes. The arrival of a new M'Kraan Crystal on this plane drew me to you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_6,"If the crystal falls into Spider-Supreme's deranged hands, he'll be even more powerful. Let me help you escape. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_INTRO_7,"Strange is giving us a chance. Let's not waste it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_START_0,"The last time someone from your dimension came through, they stole the blueprints to my fancy new collider!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_START_1,I'm not letting you leave after you saw all my cool toys!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_START_2,Protect me while I focus our mystic energies into the crystal!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_01_0,I have begun the casting...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_02_0,"The crystal is fighting back, but I am in control..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_03_0,Energies are aligning. We're close to complete!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_END_0,"The ritual is complete!\nNow, focus on the crystal!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_END_1,"America, when I hit it with my flames... do what you do."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_END_2,3... 2... 1... Now!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_04_END_3,Here goes nothing!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_0,"America?! Jean, she was left behind!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_1,The girl can certainly handle herself. As for us... what is this place?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_2,"A dimension where the M'Kraan shattered. Destroying everything. Becoming one with everything. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_3,"In our home, I prevented this. I'm not surprised the Phoenix shard was drawn here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_4,"Poor, foolish mutant. You've dragged your friends to their eternal resting place."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_5,Ultimus?!\nHow can he be here already?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_INTRO_6,"It's not Ultimus. This dimension is like a mirror, showing us a twisted reflection of our own. Prepare yourselves!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_START_0,Fate led you here. To me. To your end!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_END_0,These reflections are stronger than I imagined.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_END_1,"This entire dimension is a warped prison, doing its best to keep us in. We're lucky to have survived."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_05_END_2,Let's keep moving. I don't want to press our luck.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_0,How much deeper into this infernal hellscape must we go?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_1,"For you, sorcerer?\nThe journey is at an end."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_2,Is this the best this place can do?\nA pale reflection of myself?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_3,You think we're part of this dimension? Ha!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_4,Argh! That mystic blast...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_INTRO_5,These aren't illusions! Ultimus's mystics must have followed us!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_START_0,"Did you think your plan would go unnoticed? Ultimus sent us to pursue you from the Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_START_1,"And when the girl struck the crystal, we followed you here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_START_2,Prepare to meet your end.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_END_0,They're fleeing. But where could they possibly go?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_END_1,"They'll be lost here. We have a bigger challenge ahead, though. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_06_END_2,Me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_INTRO_0,"Jean Grey. You seek to reclaim what you let free. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_INTRO_1,You're a remnant of the Phoenix's power. I'm here to bring you back into the Phoenix Force.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_INTRO_2,My power has grown since arriving. I've become one with this place. Would you separate the stars from the sky?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_INTRO_3,If it meant preventing the end of all things.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_INTRO_4,Then come and try. And experience an end of your own.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_START_0,"If we weaken her, I can absorb the Phoenix energy and create a way out of this place."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_MID_0,"If you're bold enough to face me, let's see how you fare against reflections of your own allies."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_0,"I've seen the Phoenix's power run amok before, firsthand. You were never going to win this, little shard."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_1,Come home.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_2,"You've reabsorbed her? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_3,She was never real. Not really.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_4,"With the Phoenix recovered, the crystal, and your mystic powers we can reenter this dimension and make it Ultimus's tomb. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_5,I didn't think it could be done...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JEANGREY_07_END_6,"Maybe next time, Mordo, you'll have a little more faith."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_0,"This Stark Tech facility should be teeming with Ultimus's forces. No need for stealth. Ben, would you be kind enough to break us in?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_1,"What are you hopin' to find, Stretch-O?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_2,My instruments have been detecting a strange element building up in the layers between realities. I'm hoping to learn more here.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_3,"Sorry, Reed! The only thing you're learning is a lesson in why you don't drop in on me without at least a ""U Up?"" text."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_4,Rockets? Engage.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_5,"Huh... There's usually a bigger, earth-shattering ""Ka-Boom!"" here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_6,"Invisible force field. Sorry, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_INTRO_7,"Now, let's see what else I can make vanish."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_0,"Man, I hate all these duplicates but at least now we can prove that Iron Man's no match for the F.F.!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_1,"I wouldn't take too much pride in this fight, Johnny. These corrupted versions are fundamentally weaker than their free-willed counterparts."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_2,"Reed, dear? Maybe wait to tell him that until after the fight."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_3,INVISIBLE WOMAN IS A POWERFUL PROTECTOR WHO GRANTS <color=#fff568>BARRIER</color> AND POSITIVE EFFECTS TO HER ALLIES.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_4,"HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>STEALTH</color> TO ALL ALLIES EXCEPT THE ALLY WITH THE MOST HEALTH, GRANTING THEM OTHER POWERFUL DEFENSIVE STATUS EFFECTS."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_START_5,"INVISIBLE WOMAN'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> GRANTS <color=#fff568>BARRIER </color> TO HER TEAM, WHILE HER <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> DAMAGES ANY ENEMY WHO ATTACKS A <color=#fff568>FANTASTIC FOUR</color> MEMBER WITH BARRIER."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_0,"The data we recovered... it's not good, Fury."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_1,"Dr. Richards, you've been back home for five minutes and you're already telling me it's doomsday?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_2,"When Ultimus invades our dimension, it tears reality asunder. Each new tear keeps our world from healing, creating cosmic scar tissue."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_3,"Unless they're allowed to heal, and soon, there won't even be a dimension here for us to go to war over."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_4,"Well, if anyone has ideas about disabling Kree Eternal dimension-hopping tech, now's the time to share."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_01_END_5,"Looking at the energy signatures, Fury, it appears Ultimus's device isn't Kree. It's one of mine. I just haven't built it yet."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_0,"These are my plans for a device to facilitate an interdimensional evacuation. It was too dangerous to build, so I never completed it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_1,Ultimus must have gotten these plans from a corrupted counterpart of mine and built it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_2,"These plans... We have seen this device before, in the lab of the Spider-Supreme on another Earth."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_3,And he seemed unhinged enough to endanger all of reality with it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_4,You barely escaped last time you were in his lab. A frontal assault could be a disaster.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_5,"With my help we can get in, destroy the device, and get out. I just need a team who can deal with an evil Spider-Man."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_INTRO_6,"Ms. Storm, it sounds like you're in need of exactly our expertise."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_START_0,"Osborn, we have to work together, but just because you're S.T.R.I.K.E. doesn't mean I trust you or your team."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_START_1,"We're here to kill a Spider-Man, aren't we? Certainly you can trust us to do THAT."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_START_2,Intruders! I thought the Spider-Supreme disintegrated the Sinister Six and turned them into lab decorations?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_START_3,They must be more intruders from Nexus Earth. Looks like the Spider-Supreme is getting a new goblin-based lava lamp.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_END_0,"I can make you invisible, but I can't make you silent. If we don't keep it down, we'll be discovered before we can shut this device down."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_END_1,"Lady, we bust enough heads and ain't nobody gonna be left to discover nothin'."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_END_2,"Rude as Rhino may be, we weren't sent for our espionage skills."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_02_END_3,"Get us to the device and to this so-called Spider-Supreme, then you'll see what we bring to the table."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_0,"These mutants, they're not just corrupted, they've been genetically modified."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_1,"The last time S.T.R.I.K.E. encountered Spider-Supreme, it was Phoenix who destroyed part of his lab and escaped."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_2,"Hm, so he decided if he couldn't beat them... genetically modify them and force them to join you?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_3,"Heh. Finally, a Spider-Man I can respect. Almost a pity, I'll enjoy destroying him... marginally less."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_4,"Osborn - up ahead, more of Spider-Supreme's mutant experiments."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_INTRO_5,"Let's test his results, shall we?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_START_0,"Creed, the intruders you detected... are they here?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_START_1,"They're tryin' to hide, but I can smell 'em. And they smell like dead meat to me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_START_2,"Well, no need to keep quiet anymore. Let's go, hairball!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_MID_0,The Spider-Supreme's experiments are faltering! Let's see if we can add a few variables and get different results!
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_0,"Scientist! Don't worry, I'm here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_1,*cough* Dear leader!\nWe... we tried to fight them off...
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_2,And you succeeded! Did they discover the location of our interdimensional device?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_3,"Ha! No, the fools are two floors above it and have no clue."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_4,"Well, I guess..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_03_END_5,"...we have a clue now. For a super genius, you're not very bright, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_INTRO_0,"Okay, this is where that idiot Scientist told us the device would be."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_INTRO_1,"Careful. I'm guessing that regardless of where it is, it'll probably be protected."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_INTRO_2,"Boy, I sure hope so."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_START_0,We've got a bead on the intruders that Sabretooth went looking for! Send backup!
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_END_0,"Rhino? Move these crumpled bodies into a single pile, if you could. They're unconscious but still very much in the way."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_END_1,"Now, let's look under the hood of this machine we've heard so much about."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_END_2,"Oh, wow! More Sinister Six for me to destroy! And you're uncorrupted? What a treat."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_04_END_3,Ultimus KIND OF frowns on me destroying the Green Goblins he's got control over. (Not that that stops me.)
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_0,"So, you think you can just waltz in here and take my interdimensional garage door opener, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_1,"You need to listen to us. Even if you serve Ultimus, the device is destroying the Nexus dimension."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_2,"Um, so? What part of ""Mad Scientist"" don't you people understand?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_3,"Besides, if I stopped using it, then I wouldn't have so many extra copies of my pals to enslave! I'd have to go back to clones."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_4,"(And TRUST ME, this is so much easier than clones.)"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_INTRO_5,"Speaking of which, here come my friends now!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_START_0,"So, Rhino, OBVIOUSLY I'll stuff and mount you. With that big ol' horn? Classic."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_START_1,"But Normie, what do you think I should do with your hide? Maybe some Goblin-skin boots?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_START_2,"Ha! What a joy this version of you is, Spider. Perhaps once we're done crushing you, I'll keep you as a pet."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_MID_0,S.T.R.I.K.E. sends a band of petty criminals and a den mother to deal with us?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_MID_1,Borderline insulting. Good thing we can take that insult out on them.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_MID_2,"JESSICA JONES AND BLACK WIDOW HAVE BEEN ALTERED BY SPIDER-SUPREME! THEY'LL USE THEIR ULTIMATE ABILITY EVERY TURN. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_0,"We're clear, but for who knows how long. Mysterio, Osborn, can you disable the machine?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_1,"I've got experience dealing with interdimensional technology, but this appears more complex than I'm used to. It'll take time to disable."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_2,This is the problem with Richards' technology. With so many tubes and valves... there's no elegance.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_3,"If you continue to insult my husband, Norman, you're just making it more difficult for me to make sure you get home in one piece."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_4,"Especially considering how many pieces <b>I</b> want you to be in! Hi, remember me? And my army of pals?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_05_END_5,"We're outnumbered!\nEveryone, fall back!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_0,"Great, on the run from Spider-Man and an army of Avengers. If I wanted this, I coulda stayed in New York!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_1,"Keep complaining, Shocker, and I'll give you to Ultimus myself."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_2,"We need a plan, now."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_3,"Perhaps, yet again, I can be of assistance."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_4,"Stephen?! Are you from our world, or...?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_5,"No, this is my home. I aided S.T.R.I.K.E. before, not long ago. Unfortunately, the ensuing chaos took much out of me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_INTRO_6,"I've been trapped in this compound. But if you allow me a moment to gather my strength, I believe I can provide an escape."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_START_0,"Oh, jeez! Wow! Doctor Strange! I'm such a big fan!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_START_1,"Keep it together, mijita! We're here to defeat him, not get an autograph."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_START_2,Oh! Right! Grrr!
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_START_3,"I'll offer what assistance I can, but if I fall, you may end up trapped in this dimension!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_START_4,PROTECT <color=#fff568>DOCTOR STRANGE</color> AND DEFEAT <color=#fff568>ALL ENEMIES</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_FAIL_0,"Strange has fallen! You've trapped us here, Osborn!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_END_0,I feel the energy of the planes flowing through me. At last. I can channel my mystic force...
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_END_1,"Wait... something's not right... Osborn, we're in trouble."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_06_END_2,...into your destruction.
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_0,Stephen... how? Why?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_1,"When last I aided your friends, Spider-Supreme was able to reach me and convince me of the glory of Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_2,"Forgive the wounded sorcerer deception, but I needed the time to peer into your astral selves and sense your true purpose."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_3,"So, by ripping your dimension apart, we're making a powerful new element?! I'm so excited my Spider-Sense is TINGLING!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_4,(And not the one that detects danger.)
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_5,"We'll have to make even more trips back to your hood, if only so we can see what that stuff does once I get my hands on it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_INTRO_6,"I'll have to rescind my earlier offer to let you live, bug. Sinister Six? SQUASH them all!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_0,You guys are supposed to be the brains of this operation. How the heck do we get out of this one?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_1,"Ultimus's machine. If we reach it, we can get home."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_2,But how are we supposed to destroy the machine from Nexus Earth?
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_3,"We can't, but we can at least close the portal from behind and tell Fury what we've learned."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_4,But to do that... we need to survive this fight!
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_START_5,"SPIDER-SUPREME HAS A HIGHER CHANCE TO DODGE ATTACKS, AND WILL USE HIS ULTIMATE ABILITY TO STUN  EVERY TURN."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_MID_0,"DOCTOR STRANGE HAS BEEN ENHANCED BY SPIDER-SUPREME. EVERY OTHER TIME HE TAKES AN ACTION, DOCTOR STRANGE WILL REVIVE AN ALLY. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_0,"We're winning and they're still getting away!? Well, this is Spider-Supremely annoying!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_1,"Quickly! Through the portal, we don't have much time."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_2,"We'll be back, Spider. We'll return and I'll be taking this tech and your hide with it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_3,"Promises, promises!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_4,"Now, go now!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_5,12 Hours Later...
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_6,"Well, I've debriefed your team. This mission wasn't what I would call a rousing success."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_7,"It wasn't a failure, though. Mysterio wasn't able to disassemble Ultimus's device, but he did get a look at the modifications they made."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_8,"With that intel, I've developed a mechanism that I'm confident can disable it quickly."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_9,"Tactics 101. If Ultimus knows we need the machine, he's going to move it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_INVISIBLEWOMAN_07_END_10,Then we better find it.\nAnd find it fast.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_0,"Quake, we're getting some strange energy readings that need your attention."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_1,"Aren't energy readings more of a Reed Richards thing, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_2,"It's not the readings, it's where they're coming from: The Blue Area of the Moon."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_3,Attilan?! Is the kingdom of the Inhumans in trouble?
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_4,"Possibly. Black Bolt thinks he's protecting his people by keeping out of this, but if the fight's landed on his doorstep..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_INTRO_5,"Then helping them could finally convince them to join forces with S.T.R.I.K.E. We're on the way. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_0,Your Highness. Nick Fury sent us.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_2,"Right. Well, how can we help? Where's the problem?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_3,"Inhumans, your stand against Ultimus is futile. Those I do not destroy will be converted!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_4,"Ah, there it is."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_5,BLACK BOLT IS AN <color=#fff568>INHUMAN BLASTER</color> WHO USES THE DEVASTATING POWER OF HIS VOICE TO DEAL MASSIVE DAMAGE TO HIS ENEMIES.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_6,"BLACK BOLT'S <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> DEALS DAMAGE TO ENEMIES THE FIRST TIME THEIR HEALTH DROPS BELOW A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_START_7,"IN ADDITION TO DEALING DAMAGE, BLACK BOLT'S <color=#fff568>PASSIVE ABILITY</color> PREVENTS ANY CHARACTER HE DEFEATS FROM BEING <color=#fff568>REVIVED</color>."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_MID_0,"I'm disappointed that these Inhumans give you so much trouble, Ultron. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_MID_1,Perhaps our combined strength will teach them a lesson.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_END_0,"Fury, it's bad. Ultimus has both Ultron and Thanos attacking Attilan."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_END_1,"Ultimus wouldn't send that much firepower for a simple assault. Whatever's happening, we need to be on top of it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_END_2,I'm calling down the thunder.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_01_END_3,Let us see how Ultron and Thanos fare against our might now.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_INTRO_0,"Blackagar Boltagon, ruler of the Inhumans! The mighty Thor greets you!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_INTRO_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_INTRO_2,"I see his vocabulary is only slightly more limited than yours, brother."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_INTRO_3,"Black Bolt's voice can level mountains, Loki. Keep needling, perhaps he'll have a word with you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_INTRO_4,"Fear not, friend. We shall halt this attack on your city and free your people from the threat of Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_START_0,"So, Fury sends his Asgardians. Make this easy on yourselves. Give me Black Bolt."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_START_1,"Thanos, Black Bolt does not hide. The Inhuman King speaks for himself."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_START_2,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_0,"My lord, Thanos and his forces retreat!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_1,"They have fallen back, aye, but it is no retreat. They were purchasing time."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_2,You appear to be correct. I see our foes readying a great contraption at the core of the city!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_3,"A false retreat and now a ""contraption""? I know a sinister scheme when I see one."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_4,We must take the city back... Wait... What is that rumble?
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_5,The ground shakes! By Odin!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_02_END_6,Attilan! It's... gone!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_0,They opened a portal large enough to swallow the entire Inhuman capital!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_1,"I see it, Lady Sif. By Odin... We must go through it and give chase."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_2,"Well, Thanos and Ultron are gone. What say we leave and celebrate a job well done?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_3,"Black Bolt, shall we follow the cowardly advice of my brother? Or charge forth into the unknown?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_INTRO_5,Aye! Asgardians! To battle!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_START_0,"A jungle... Heimdall, can your sight give us guidance?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_START_1,"We are on an Earth, on the southmost point of the globe."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_START_2,"All that matters is that you are in the Kree Empire, trespassers. And you are now my prisoners."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_0,"Trapped in the Savage Land, on an Earth that belongs to the Kree.\nHappy now, oh mighty Thor?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_1,"These Kree are servants of Ultimus, which means we are set on the right path."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_2,"My lord, someone approaches."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_3,"I guess I can't feel too bad about being spotted. You are gods, after all."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_4,"We are ready for battle, Widow. Do not test us."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_03_END_5,I wouldn't dream of it. You're exactly who we need to help us resist Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_0,We haven't had Asgardians here in... a long time. Not since Ultimus and the Kree took over.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_1,"We can give aid, Widow, but we are in the middle of a quest already. To find Attilan."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_2,The Inhuman city?\nPretty sure it's on the moon.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_3,Our Attilan is not. Ultimus has brought it here. We gave chase but know not where it hides.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_4,"Passing through the portal has clouded my vision. All I know is that it is near. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_INTRO_5,"Well, if it's on our Earth, I have S.H.I.E.L.D. satellites that can find it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_0,I just need a minute to align the satellites...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_1,Natasha! I come home early and find you with... Ultimus's Asgardians?! I'm shocked!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_2,"Wade, these are Asgardians from another dimension, they're not with Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_3,"Oh, sure, like they just ""dropped out of the sky"" through ""a magic portal."""
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_4,OR is it more likely that you did a patented Black Widow double-cross against the resistance?! You're coming with me!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_START_5,PROTECT <color=#fff568>BLACK WIDOW</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_01_0,"Okay, I've connected to the satellites. Just need to align them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_02_0,I'm honing in on Attilan's location! Almost there...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_03_0,The city is here in the Savage Land! Just need to narrow down the quadrant.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_OPERATOR_FAIL_0,"My link to the satellite is broken! I'm sorry, we can't find Attilan."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_0,I've got it! I know where Attilan is!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_1,"Cease your attack, talkative one, lest you feel Mjolnir's swing again."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_2,"Okay, okay! I give! Yeesh.\nAll you had to do was ask."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_3,I thought you were with Ultimus! How many times do I have to say sorry?
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_4,You haven't said it once.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_5,"Sure I did! ""..."""
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_04_END_6,"It's not my fault you don't speak Inhuman. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_INTRO_0,"Thor, Black Bolt? Attilan isn't far. We can get you there but getting in won't be easy."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_INTRO_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_INTRO_2,"I do not know Black Bolt's words, but I know his heart. We shall meet the challenge head on!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_START_0,"Ah, here you are! Be a collective dear and surrender so we might end you quickly, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_START_1,"My, such palpable condescension. I think I like this one."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_05_END_0,"Tsk, this group of so-called sorcerers were no match for us. If only they'd asked, I could have told them that from the start."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_0,"We're inside the city, but where are the Inhumans? This stillness worries me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_1,"Quiet is an ill omen, Lady Sif. It's why I prefer thunder."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_2,"Ahead, my liege! I see a great technological abhorrence."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_3,What is this device? I see Ultron's handiwork as well as that of the Inhumans...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_4,"Well observed, trickster. Ultron allows me to combine the Terrigen Mists with Ultimus's Conversion Engine."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_5,"This corrupted mist will change anyone exposed to it, not just Inhumans. And all of them will be loyal to Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_6,"Not if Black Bolt and I destroy this abomination first, Titan."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_INTRO_7,"You? Heh.\nUltron, clear away these gnats for me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_START_0,You heard the boss. Let's soften these Asgardians up for Ultron.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_MID_0,False gods of flesh! Bow before your technological superior!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_MID_1,"Robot, you are nothing but rattling steel to be re-forged by my hammer."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_END_0,No! My machinery... destroyed! By you pathetic beings of meat? How?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_06_END_2,"Well said, good Black Bolt."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_INTRO_0,"Your foul machinery is destroyed, and your clockwork warrior defeated! You will have no corrupted Terrigen this day, Thanos."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_INTRO_1,"You were swift, Asgardian.\nBut not swift enough."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_INTRO_2,"Oh, very clever. Don't you see, brother? He already has some."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_INTRO_3,Just enough corrupted Terrigen to enhance my powers.\nEnough to be your end.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_INTRO_4,"And once I've crushed you under my heel, Black Bolt, I will turn to your city... and see it turned to rubble."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_START_1,Can you not tell what the King of the Inhumans demands?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_START_2,BRING HIM THANOS!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_MID_0,Here I am... Come and get me!
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_0,"Surrender, Thanos. You have been bested."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_1,You see this as victory? You've done nothing but momentarily delay Ultimus's victory.
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_2,"Perhaps. But with the aid of the Inhumans, perhaps not."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_3,"Black Bolt, your people are safe and shall soon be returned home. Will you aid S.T.R.I.K.E.?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_4,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_5,"Aye! I am glad to know you, good king."
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_6,How have you been able to glean ANYTHING from this living statue?
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_7,"Noble warriors need not words to know each other, Loki!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_BLACKBOLT_07_END_8,"As sure as I am the God of Thunder, we may depend on Black Bolt and the Inhumans!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_0,"ATTILAN, KINGDOM OF THE INHUMANS\nTHE BLUE AREA OF THE MOON..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_1,Storm the gates! Take no prisoners! Seize Attilan... For Doom!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_2,"Phew, okay, I just need a breather... Then... Let me at 'em..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_3,"Kamala, rest. You're exhausted. We all are. This siege appears endless. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_4,"When Fury told us to guard Earth while he was gone, I don't think he expected Doctor Doom to strike."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_5,"Attilan may not hold much longer, Crystal. For the first time in my memory... I feel fear."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_6,"What does Black Bolt say, Crystal? What would he have us do?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_7,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_INTRO_8,He says we fight... to the last Inhuman. To battle!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_START_0,"Okay, I got a second wind! I don't care how many baddies there are, I can embiggen enough for all of 'em!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_START_1,"We could all use some of your bravery, kid. Let's do it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_0,"We're holding them off, but even more reinforcements arrive! I fear this is the end of us."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_2,"Perhaps I, a humble servant of Thanos, can be of assistance. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_3,...?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_4,"EBONY MAW IS THE <color=#fff568>BLACK ORDER'S SUPPORT</color>, WHO USES HIS SINISTER POWERS TO MANIPULATE STATUS EFFECTS AND DRAIN THE ENEMY TEAM. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_5,"EBONY MAW'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> GRANTS ALLIES <color=#fff568>DEFENSE UP</color> WHILE APPLYING <color=#fff568>OFFENSE DOWN</color> TO ALL ENEMIES. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_MID_6,"HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> STEALS HEALTH FROM ALL ENEMIES AND <color=#fff568>SLOWS</color> THEM, GIVING THE STOLEN HEALTH TO HIS ALLIES."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_0,Ebony Maw... He turned the tide. What trickery is this?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_1,"Your royal highness, Black Bolt. I, Ebony Maw, humble servant of Thanos, have arrived at your aid."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_2,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_3,"Black Bolt says that, given your master, he's eager for you to explain yourself. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_4,"My master is by Nick Fury's side, battling Ultimus on Hala. But while Thanos is powerful, he is also clever. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_5,"The Black Order seeks an additional way to defeat Ultimus. One I need the aid of the powerful Inhumans to acquire. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_01_END_6,"I speak, of course... of the Infinity Stones."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_0,Do you really think us foolish enough to help Thanos find the Infinity Stones?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_1,"The opposite. I think Black Bolt is wise enough to see that Doom has taken hold of the Nexus, and he will not let it go easily."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_2,"In a nearby dimension, three stones are being held in one place. We can seize them in one fell swoop. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_3,"The stones are too powerful to be in the hands of one being. We get them, we'll need to bring them straight to S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_4,"As you wish. Aid me, oh Black Bolt, and I promise the Infinity Stones shall only be used to protect the Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_5,"Black Bolt, what's the play here? We can't win against Doom without him. But we can't trust him either. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_6,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_INTRO_7,Excellent. Our first step... \nfinding a way out of this reality.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_START_0,"Doom has blocked entrance to Nexus, but not exit. The portal in this base of Ultimus's on Mercury should lead to the reality with the stones."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_START_1,"Hey, Sam! Looks like we have some party crashers. Should we crash back?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_START_2,"Ultimus is defeated, which means we've got nothing left to lose. Let's blow this base and take them all with it.  "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_START_3,DEFEAT THE <color=#fff568>ENEMY OPERATORS</color> BEFORE THEY DESTROY THE FACILITY.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_01_0,Planting enough charges to destroy this base and take all of us with it!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_01_1,"1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_02_0,Charges planted! Arming now...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_02_1,"2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_03_0,All explosives are armed! Ready to detonate...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_03_1,"3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,The fools! They're bringing this facility down around us!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_END_0,"Those corrupted Avengers were going to blow us all to heck! What the, uh... heck?!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_END_1,They mentioned that Ultimus was defeated. S.T.R.I.K.E. must have been successful on Hala!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_END_2,"A glorious victory, to be sure. But we have no idea at what cost it came. We must hurry to our destination."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_02_END_3,"Come, my Inhuman friends! Through the portal..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_0,Woah. A city of golden spires combined with tech that looks... Kree-like? They're beautiful.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_1,"And ominous. Where are we, Maw?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_2,"You're right to feel dread. We are on Asgard, but not as you know it. Eons ago, this Asgard was conquered by the Kree Empire."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_3,"Imagine the power and arrogance of Odin and the Supreme Intelligence combined. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_4,"Power which let them capture three stones. And arrogance that kept all three in the one place together, the Palace Vault."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_5,"Okay. We break into this vault, get the stones, and then..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_INTRO_6,"Do not concern yourselves with what happens next, invaders. You will not live to see it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_START_0,You attempt to invade the great Kree capitol of Asgard? With this scant force?
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_START_1,"When I saw them enter our world, I was almost insulted at their number, Accuser."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_START_2,"Let us demonstrate the offense we've suffered, Heimdall. With our weapons!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_0,"Splendid! The might of the Inhumans has not been exaggerated, o' Black Bolt."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_1,"Now, follow me to the Palace Vault, and we may be on our way. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_2,"I don't get it, your highness! You trust this big ol' creep?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_3,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_4,"Our king doesn't trust any who serve Thanos, Kamala, Ebony Maw least of all."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_03_END_5,"But Black Bolt has faith that, when Maw betrays us, the might of the Inhumans shall prevail."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_0,"When you said the stones were in the ""Palace Vault,"" I thought you meant the vault was IN the palace, not the SIZE of one!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_1,"The spoils of an empire of Kree and Asgardians are vast. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_2,"Once we enter, we must find the stones quickly for they shall not be unguarded. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_3,"Okay, so how do we get in?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_4,Karnak? I believe you can see exactly the flaw in this security system.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_INTRO_5,"Yes. And one well-placed blow should exploit it. Get ready, everyone! Here we go!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_START_0,"So, enemies of the Empire wish to steal its wealth! Prepare to fall, thieves, before Thor, the Accuser!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_START_1,"Ugh, what is it with these guys and their hammers?!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_END_0,"Okay, no more Thors! We did it! Right, guys? That was the end?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_END_1,"My reconnaissance revealed the location of the stones, so we are not far, child."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_04_END_2,But... you should expect more resistance once we find them.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_INTRO_0,"The stones! Yes, I can sense them, they're close. Quickly, now!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_INTRO_1,"Watch Maw closely, Quake. We need him, but do not let your guard down."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_INTRO_2,"Yes! They're here! The Reality, Time, and Soul Stones, within our grasp..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_INTRO_3,"True! Now, please, reach out your hand! And have it lopped off!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_START_0,"Silly mortals want to play with gods' toys, hmm?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_START_1,"Well, if you want to play, let's play! Try and keep up!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_START_2,"Heimdall, close the gates to this vault and seal our new playmates in with us!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_START_3,DEFEAT THE <color=#fff568>ENEMY OPERATORS</color> BEFORE THEY SEAL THE VAULT
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_01_0,"I have begun the process of sealing your prey in, my Queen."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_01_1,"1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_02_0,"I am using the Bifrost to rearrange the rooms in the vault. They'll never find their way out. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_02_1,"2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_03_0,A few more gates to close and then... they're sealed in for good!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_03_1,"3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,They've closed every part of the vault! We're cut off from the Infinity Stones... And our way out!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_0,"Here they are... the stones. Thank you for your aid, Black Bolt. Now, if you will stand aside..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_2,"The king reminds you of your promise. You take the stones, and we use them to protect the Nexus. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_3,"Of course. Now, so close, I can access all that power..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_4,"...to summon the stones' one true master! Come, Thanos, and take your rightful place at the crossroads of the multiverse!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_05_END_5,"Maw. You have served me well, yet again. Now, let us dispose of this Inhuman trash. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_0,"Lord Thanos, I present you with your bounty... The Soul Stone. The Time Stone. And the Reality Stone. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_1,"Using their power to draw me to you once you found them was wise, faithful servant. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_2,"It's time, master. Time for you to show the multiverse what destiny looks like. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_3,"What happened to your promise, Maw?! You have no honor?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_4,"I pledged to use to the stones to keep the Nexus safe, Inhuman. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_5,And who better to guard it than glorious Thanos?
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_6,"We can still stop him. He's only got half the stones. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_7,A fair point.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_INTRO_8,"Ebony Maw, bring your brothers and sister here. It's time the Black Order is made whole again."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_0,"Come, Black Order! Arrive and bring with you the power our master so richly deserves!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_1,We humbly serve!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_2,"Claim your strength, and direct us as your will dictates, Lord Thanos."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_3,"At last. The gauntlet... Complete. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_4,"WHEN ON A TEAM WITH THE BLACK ORDER, THANOS COMPLETES THE INFINITY GAUNTLET AND BECOMES <color=#fff568>EMPOWERED</color>!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_5,"AN <color=#fff568>EMPOWERED</color> CHARACTER HAS NEW, MORE DEVASTATING VERSIONS OF THEIR ABILITIES. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_START_6,UNLEASH THE POWER OF THE INFINITY GAUNTLET ON YOUR ENEMIES AND EXPERIENCE THE GLORY OF <color=#fff568>EMPOWERED</color> THANOS!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_0,"Stop... you can't... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_1,"Can't? I think you'll find, little Inhuman, that word no longer applies to me. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_2,"Now, to return to the Nexus and leave you stranded here, to the mercy of the Kree."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_3,"Hmm. I willed our return to the Nexus, and yet we remain. Maw, what false stones have you brought me?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_4,"They are true, Lord Thanos! I don't know what prevents our return! Please, allow me to examine them..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_5,"Heh, guess there are a few things you can't do. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_6,"For that, insect, I'll make you watch as I kill your king. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_7,"So, Black Bolt? Any final words, or will you remain silent as your people die?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_8,...Never.
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_06_END_9,ARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_0,"My king, are you alright?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_1,"Your cry wounded Thanos and his Black Order, my lord. They've retreated through a portal. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_2,"We're badly hurt, Black Bolt. Should we regroup?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_3,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_4,"The king is right. The Black Order having the Infinity Stones is too dangerous. We have to follow. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_INTRO_5,"Through the portal. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_START_0,What is this place? It's a wasteland...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_START_1,GGGGGGGraaaaagh...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_START_2,"Mindless, corrupted Avengers incoming! We'll find answers later!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_END_0,Bleck! I hated seeing Iron Man and the Hulk like that! What's wrong with them?
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_END_1,"They were corrupted, but like none we'd seen before. They had no will of their own at all. Like they were husks. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_END_2,"The beings of this world were broken by the Conversion Engine, left too mindless to be soldiers, but still deadly enough to be weapons."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_07_END_3,"And now that you've followed me to their home, I'll use these husks to end you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_0,"I earn my redemption through your destruction, Inhuman. Prepare to die, in tribute to Thanos."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_1,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_2,Stoic as ever. But let's see you dare stand against the might of three Infinity Stones!
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_3,"Stones that failed you and your master once, Maw. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_4,I see. I see why they're not working as you desire. Can you?
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_INTRO_5,"Perhaps you'll tell me, Karnak. In between screams for mercy! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_START_0,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_START_1,"Do not let up! Do not falter! We will win this battle, as Inhumans!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_START_2,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_0,I... I don't understand. The stones...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_1,"These Infinity Stones are powerful, true. But I see their weakness."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_2,"Removed from their original dimensions, they are no longer the gateway to omnipotence your master desires."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_3,"I've failed... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_4,"True. But while these stones won't allow me to bring order to the Nexus directly, they can still be of use. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_5,"We'll keep these stones, silent king. And we'll use them as promised, to help S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_6,"What?! No way, we totally can't let them keep these stones, can we?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_7,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_8,Lord Black Bolt has decreed...
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_9,"I need no translation. Your lord has weighed the risk of extending our temporary alliance... and has found it acceptable. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_10,"True. But he also decrees that once we no longer need you... Black Bolt shall enact justice swiftly, and personally."
ID_DIALOG_LE_EBONYMAW_08_END_11,...
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_0,All S.T.R.I.K.E. agents! Our base has been discovered! Get to battle stations!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_1,"How'd Doom find us? We just moved into this secret hideout! I barely had time to unpack my underoos. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_2,"Since Doom took over Earth, he's turned people against S.T.R.I.K.E.  "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_3,"Someone must have spotted us, called it in, and now we have Doom's army of villains knocking down our door. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_4,"Sorry, Fury. I'm used to the public hating me, but this must be new for you."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_INTRO_5,"I didn't get in the spy game to be liked, Parker. Now get to your station, this fight isn't going to be easy!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_START_0,"Knock knock, S.T.R.I.K.E.! Did your little rebellion really think you could hide from Doom?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_START_1,"Do I look scared to you? Doom's not the first dictator I've gotten rid of. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_0,"We're getting overrun up here! S.T.R.I.K.E. forces, get ready to abandon base..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_1,"Not so fast, Director Fury. These fools did not count on having to contend with the genius of me, Otto Octavius!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_2,"What?! Doc Ock? Is someone pranking me? Wolverine, is that you in a very convincing bodysuit?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_3,"We will deal with your ego later, arachnid! For now, Doctor Octopus is here to save you all. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_4,"A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS AND MASTER MANIPULATOR, DOCTOR OCTOPUS IS THE LEADER OF <color=#fff568>THE SINISTER SIX</color>!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_5,"DOCTOR OCTOPUS'S <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> SUMMONS A MISSING MEMBER OF THE <color=#fff568>SINISTER SIX</color> TO THE FIGHT. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_MID_6,HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> ATTACKS ALL ENEMIES AND FLIPS <color=#fff568>POSITIVE EFFECTS</color> TO <color=#fff568>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</color> .
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_0,"Okay, Octavius. What's your game here?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_1,"I expected a little more gratitude, Fury. My compatriots and I did just swoop in and rescue you, after all."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_2,"Well, excuse me for not rolling out the red carpet for every six-armed maniac who comes bearing gifts. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_3,"More than gifts, Director. I come with the chance for freedom."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_4,"While you gallivanted among the cosmos, we remained here on Earth, resisting Doom's empire."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_01_END_5,"With my genius and your resources, we can rid Earth of the tyranny of Doom, once and for all!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_0,"Doom has concealed crucial pieces of his operation. But through sheer force of intellect, I have discovered them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_1,"With my impeccable planning, we can disrupt these key stations of Doom's, and gain an advantage against him."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_2,You seem pretty confident. What do you need us for? Why don't you use your Sinister Six?
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_3,Rhino? Shocker? They're blunt instruments. But this operation requires a scalpel.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_4,"While no one in S.T.R.I.K.E. is a match for Otto Octavius's brilliance, you do command a number of black ops teams. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_5,"So? What do you say, Fury?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_6,"I think I know exactly the team. X-Force? Fall in. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_INTRO_7,"Ooooh, a road trip! I'll bring the jerky!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_START_0,"I bodyslid the team into the warehouse in New York you told us about. What's so special about this place, Ock?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_START_1,"This is the central port for all of Doom's exports to Europe. We disrupt him here, his supply lines falter."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_START_2,"You face the Hand, intruders! You've returned to Earth only to die here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_END_0,Red pajamas! Don't you hate it when you show up to a party and someone's wearing the same thing as you?
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_END_1,"How do you stand this buffoon? He's worse than the spider... Almost. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_END_2,"Deadpool has his uses. Like, for instance, taking out those Hand who are escaping. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_02_END_3,"What?! They can't be allowed to warn Doom! Our assault has only just begun. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_INTRO_0,"Mystics! Prepare a portal out of Hell's Kitchen. We'll regroup and inform Lord Doom what's transpired here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_INTRO_1,"Ah, Elektra. I've read up on you. Master assassin, leader of the Hand. I even heard tell you returned from the dead!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_INTRO_2,"This time, my dear, you won't be so lucky. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_START_0,"Ock, if you're done giving speeches, we've got an operation to run."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_START_1,"If we don't take out those mystics, they're going to report back to Doom and we're done. Dom? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_START_2,"On it, Nate. Their luck is about to run out. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_START_3,DEFEAT THE ENEMY OPERATORS BEFORE THEY ESCAPE!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_01_0,Your pathetic efforts to stop us are pointless.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_02_0,Focus your fire on the operators! We can't let them escape!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_03_0,"The portal is almost open! Hand, cover our exit! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,"You imbeciles! If you let them escape, you will answer to Doctor Octopus! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_END_0,"Excellent work, underlings. The Hand has fallen, and Doom's supply line is broken."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_END_1,"Though, Cable, your tone with me was... unacceptable. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_END_2,Don't forget who's in charge here.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_03_END_3,"Oh, don't worry. I haven't. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_0,"Next stop, Peru. What are we facing there?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_1,"Ask the octopus. Apparently he's running the show. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_2,"Hmph. We're heading to Peru, where I have uncovered a secret Hydra lab. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_3,"While most of the world has traded Doom's security for their freedom, ""partial domination"" is hardly enough for the tyrant."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_4,"Hydra's been using modified genetic material from Swarm to turn the populace into an easily controlled hive-mind for Doom. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_INTRO_5,Our brains will be like cereal left soaking in milk for too long!\nNo one likes that! Let's go!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_START_0,"Ah, Doctor Octopus! I wondered what became of you after your escape from Doom's prison. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_START_1,"Well, whatever hole you crawled out of, you will wish you'd remained there instead of facing Hydra!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_END_0,"Remove one head, two more shall take its place! Hydra cannot be defeated!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_END_1,"Oh yeah? I'm from the future, Skull. And back home, no one's even heard of Hydra."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_04_END_2,Then I shall have to etch its name into your mind! Unleash our S.W.A.R.M. technology!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_0,"Hydra is further along in their development of the mind-control technology than I thought. They're unleashing it now. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_1,"Domino, Negasonic! Hit them hard, hit them fast. We don't have a lot of time here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_2,"You got it, boss."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_3,"Wade, do what you do and sow chaos. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_4,No problem! I've got a pogo stick and a LOT of bullets.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_5,"Careful, Cable... You are dangerously close to overstepping."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_INTRO_6,"Scold me later. Right now? I have a job to do. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_START_0,They're through the perimeter! Hold them off while we prepare the mind-altering field!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_START_1,"Ah, Hydra. You think your tentacles grasp the world? Let me introduce you to what real reach is."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_START_2,"DEFEAT THE ENEMY OPERATORS TO WIN. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_01_0,We've begun initializing the telepathic crowd control device! Powering up now...
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_02_0,"The energy field is half powered! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_03_0,Our device has reached full power. Preparing to unleash it! Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_03_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_OPERATOR_LOSE_0,Arggh! Even my intellect... Cannot withstand this device... We've lost!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_0,"We've crushed your device, Skull. We've ruined your little base for Doom. Now that we're alone..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_1,"Where is it? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_2,Heh... Your friends... Do they know what it is you truly seek?
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_3,"Those clueless brutes? I doubt they have a thought between them. Now, tell me what I want to know, before I tighten my grasp further."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_4,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_05_END_5,"Hm. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_0,"Dom, Octavius is up to something. I need you to keep an eye on all six of his arms."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_1,"What is it? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_2,"Not sure. Whatever it is, this attack on a Kazakhstani factory is part of it. Here he comes now."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_3,"Ah, my good little soldiers. Here you are. As we set out on this final mission... Who knows what a Doombot is?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_4,"Robot replicas of Doctor Doom! To keep you company on those cold, cold Latverian nights."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_5,"...Partially correct. They're Doom's robotic police force. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_6,"At this former Ultron factory, Doom will fuse Doombots with Ultron tech, and spread them across the world. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_INTRO_7,Or he would. If Otto Octavius was not here to stop him!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_START_0,"Wow, if it isn't Otto Octavius! I really thought Doom had offed you. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_START_1,"I guess the good news is I get to do it myself, instead. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_END_0,"At last! Here, inside this vault, I find what I have sought since being freed from Doom's infernal prison!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_END_1,"Hands up, Octavius. All of them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_END_2,"I don't know what you're after, but I know when a maniac wants something, you don't let them get it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_END_3,"Cable! I'm simply reclaiming what's mine! Here, about to be melted down, lies what Doom stole from me! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_06_END_4,The Adamantium arms of Doctor Octopus!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_0,This whole globe-trotting trip to take out Doom... Was just so you could reacquire your old Adamantium arms?
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_1,"It served both purposes. I, too, want to see Doom's reign cast off from the world."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_2,"And these arms make me immensely powerful. I couldn't simply let Doom melt them down inside this Ultron facility. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_3,"Well, I'm glad you two were reunited. Now, step away from them. We're headed back to S.T.R.I.K.E. Fury can sort this out."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_4,"First Doom defiles my facility! Now I come to reclaim it and find it infested with you FLESH things! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_5,Prepare to feel Ultron's full wrath and be wiped from existence!
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_INTRO_6,Octavius... Put on the arms.
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_START_0,"Hey there, big, mad, and shiny! We were just leaving your stupid factory! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_START_1,"It's too late to flee, organics! The indignity of your presence here offends me to my core!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_START_2,"Then allow me and my new arms to rip it out of you, Ultron!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_END_0,"Hahahaha! Ah, it's been too long since I've felt the power of these arms. It feels good to reduce an Ultron to scrap."
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_END_1,"Well, that's not creepy at all! Glad we gave you those super powerful arms!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_END_2,"Hey, Cable! You want me to oot-shay this erd-nay?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_END_3,"Stand down, Wade. Octavius might be pompous, evil, and manipulative... But he's proven he's no friend of Doom's. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_DOCTOROCTOPUS_07_END_4,"And whether I like it or not, that makes you a part of S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_0,"The X-Mansion, Deep Within the Microverse..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_1,"Marauders! This Danger Room technology is ours for the taking. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_2,"Hey! Ain't no five-finger-discount here, lady! We're sold out, so get lost!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_3,"Well, well, if it isn't Jubilee! And, curious... Your mind tells me you're not from our world!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_4,"From Nexus Earth, eh? I must admit, I'm surprised to see you here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_5,"Yeah, I pop up in all kinds of places you wouldn't expect. Well, now that you've seen me, you can go!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_6,"Child, the Shi'ar technology in that Danger Room belongs to all mutants."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_INTRO_7,I will simply be leaving with what's already mine.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_0,"So, I'm kinda busy right now, can I totally ignore you some other time?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_1,"You'll find, my dear, that the White Queen is impossible to ignore."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_2,JUBILEE'S <color=#fff568>BASIC</color> HIT <color=#fff568>BLINDS</color> ENEMIES.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_3,"IF CALLING ALL HER ASTONISHING X-MEN TEAMMATES TO <color=#fff568>ASSIST</color> WASN'T ENOUGH,"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_4,HER <color=#fff568>SPECIAL</color> CALLS <color=#fff568>ASSISTS</color> FROM OTHER FRIENDS HANGING WITH HER TOO.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_START_5,JUBILEE'S <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE</color> IS A <color=#fff568>PIERCING STUN</color> ATTACK THAT <color=#fff568>SLOWS</color> SECONDARY TARGETS AND REDUCES <color=#fff568>SPEED BARS</color>.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_0,"Shall we drop the pretense, Jubilee? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_1,"We both know the X-Men aren't here. These so-called allies are mere Danger Room constructs. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_2,"Did you really think you could fool a telepath? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_3,"We're in the Microverse. I figured maybe your brain was tiny, too."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_4,"If you want to play with illusions, maybe my associate can provide some. Mysterio, if you please?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_5,"Happy to make my grand entrance, Ms. Frost!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_01_END_6,"More of them?! Okay, Cass, any time you want to answer that distress call I sent…"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_0,"The Helicarrier, Nexus Earth..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_1,"Um, Dad? Hope?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_2,"What's up, Peanut?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_3,"So, I KIND OF MAYBE have been going to the Microverse with Jubilee? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_4,Like just for a minute to go to super cool concerts and stuff but now the X-Men...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_5,...are missing and there's a distress signal and Emma Frost is attacking and I know I SHOULDN'T...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_6,"Woah, woah, woah! Slow down! Concerts? Microverse? What? Distress signal?!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_7,"Scott? It sounds like we should rescue Jubilee now, and ask questions on the way. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_INTRO_8,"Right. Everyone get ready to get small, we've got a friend to save. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_START_0,"Just imagine the kinds of illusions I'll be able to conjure once I take this tech from you, Jubilee!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_START_1,I'm imagining rabbits in hats. Please let it be rabbits in hats.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_START_2,Hey! People I actually invited to this party are here now!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_START_3,"Sorry, Mysterio. Time to bounce."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_0,"Welp, we give up. You win. You're just TOO powerful for us."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_1,Really?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_2,"Like, no. Sarcasm just kinda falls out of my mouth like stupid falls out of yours."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_3,"Mock me, but my task is complete. While I kept you busy, Frost acquired what we needed!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_4,"Soon, the world will tremble at the power of our illusions. So long, fools!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_5,"He got away! Ugh, this has been SUCH a bummer of a day!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_6,"Well, at least you're safe. Now, let's get back to our Earth."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_7,"No way, Gramps! The X-Men are missing, and Frost stole their tech on my watch! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_8,We've gotta stop her! And I know where to start looking.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_02_END_9,Heh… Gramps...
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_0,"I show up here in the Microverse. I make Micro-X-friends. Now, they're gone. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_1,"And now Frosty has their tech and, I don't know, I kinda feel like it's all my fault."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_2,"Jubilee! No! Go easy on yourself. We're going to find them, and get the tech! It's going to be great."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_3,"Ghost was able to track Emma to this bunker. We sneak in, we get the tech, and we leave. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_4,"Breaking into places is what we're best at. No sweat. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_INTRO_5,"Oh really? Sounds like you've never tried sneaking past me. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_START_0,"Wait, Natasha? You're evil here? We need rules for who's evil in the Microverse."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_START_1,"You're sneaking into Emma Frost's base to steal stuff. How do you know you're not evil? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_START_2,"Yeah, and we just call it ''the universe'' here!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_START_3,"Just so you know, you two are, like, WAY cooler in our universe."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_0,"Okay, if I was some lame-o with too many white fur capes, where would I keep my stolen tech?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_1,"Ungh… Oh, my stars and garters, my head."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_2,"Beastie! You're okay! I know I'm not from your world, but you guys are still my family. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_3,"And you, ours, Jubilation."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_4,Do you know where the other X-Men are?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_5,"I'm afraid not. Emma commandeered all our minds, but she kept me here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_6,"She forced me to unlock the tech she plundered, and combine it with Mysterio's."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_7,"She's going to put our little world inside a global Danger Room, with herself at the control panel."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_03_END_8,"Well, let's go break the stuff, and get our family back!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_0,"Unlike your world, our Reed Richards is not on the side of the angels. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_1,Emma will have gone to him to help finish the work she forced me to start.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_2,Why is Mister Fantastic in a fairground in the Netherlands?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_3,Haarlemmermeer's longitude makes it the perfect place to set up Frost's illusions.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_4,"If we save the Microverse and everything, we need to come back here! It's soooo cute!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_5,"Totally, this place knows how to party. Until Microverse Reed Richards crashes it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_INTRO_6,"I'm sorry to ruin your good time, Miss Lee. Perhaps I can entertain your friends in my own way!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_START_0,"Let me show you what I've been working on! I flip a switch, and reality becomes my guinea pig."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_START_1,Scott! Jubilee! Don't let Dr. Richards activate that device or all is lost!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_START_2,I get it! Let's wreck his stuff.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_OPERATOR_01_0,"Hey, Rubberband Man, this fell off your machine! Was it important?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_OPERATOR_01_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.

ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_OPERATOR_02_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_OPERATOR_03_0,Wow! There's really not much left to smash. How is this thing still on?

ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_OPERATOR_04_0,ALL STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_LOSS_0,"You've failed! Now to see what makes those Pym suits work, once I pry you out of them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_0,"You think you've won? Emma can still turn on the Shi'ar tech, this was simply the remote activator. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_1,"Guess we'll have to blow that stuff up too, then. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_2,"If this is the remote activator, it's transmitting to the other machines."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_3,"I can pinpoint their location, and if you can access them, I can disable each device from here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_4,"Copy that, Fuzzy Feet!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_5,Dad! Can you get us there?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_04_END_6,"Probably? I mean, sure. Yes, I can do that. Oh, right now? Let's go!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_0,"You're nearing the first of Emma's devices now. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_1,"Be careful, she certainly has some of her mind-controlled X-Men protecting it."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_2,"Um, does that include Bishop? 'Cuz I'm lookin' right at him."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_3,"I'm alright, child. Frost released me after she used my energy abilities to power her machine."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_4,"Unfortunately, she hasn't loosened her grasp on Bobby."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_5,"Uh, is it getting chilly in here? My mask is getting all fogged up."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_INTRO_6,And it's about to get a whole lot colder.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_START_0,"Bobby! You gotta snap outta' this! It's me, Jubilee!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_START_1,"Yeah, but you're not our Jubilee. Emma's right! I can't trust you!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_START_2,"You know, in movies they just bop brainwashed people on the head. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_START_3,"Yeah, let's try that. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_0,"You okay, Bobby? We cool?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_1,"Yeah... We're cool. Sorry, I swore I'd never let Emma get in my head again. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_2,"I'm just glad we didn't have to, like, turn you into cubes. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_3,"Mr. McCoy, I got the thingamabob at the whatchamacallit."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_4,"Well done, Jubilee. I'm uploading the malware protocol now."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_5,"Thanks, Beastie! Ant-Dad, can you zip us to the next location?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_6,"No problem. At this rate, though, I should probably get a minivan. Like a REALLY mini-van. ...Get it?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_05_END_7,"Dad, you are embarrassing me in front of the X-Men!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_0,I still can't believe you two came all the way to the Microverse just to what... see some concerts?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_1,We wanted to see if their K-pop was as good as our K-pop!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_2,"Um, also, at the right show we're like, a total two-person party?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_3,"When Cassie's ginormous, and she's all ""WOMP WOMP WOMP!"" and the bass gets crazy."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_4,"I let loose the plasmoid fireworks display and the people are like ""Woooaaahhh!!!"" "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_5,"Uh, do you kids know grunge? I liked grunge when I was your age. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_6,"Uh, how about we focus on blowing up the next amplifier? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_INTRO_7,Emma warned me you'd be trying to do that. She also ordered me to stop you.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_START_0,"Kitty, you were, like, the original teen X-Men! Don't make me totally kick your butt."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_START_1,"Sorry, Jubes, but if you want to stop Emma Frost, you have to go through me."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_START_2,"Wait, can't we go through you really easily? That's your whole thing."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_START_3,"It's a figure of speech! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_0,"Jubilee! Thank you for snapping me out of it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_1,"And I'm SO sorry I called you ""Jubes,"" I know you hate that."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_2,"No biggie, Kitty. Everything copacetic? Where's Emma?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_3,"You destroyed her transmitters, so she used my phasing powers for her new plan. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_4,"Jubilee, she's trying to take the last device into your universe. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_06_END_5,"Ugh! How can someone named Emma FROST be, like, so TOTALLY uncool?!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_0,"That pesky teen may have stopped us from dominating the Microverse, but we're not done."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_1,"With your abilities, we can take this device into the Nexus and rule their world!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_2,"Wow, are you like, talking to yourself? Um, whack job much?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_3,Jubilee! You found me? I'm almost glad. Now we can take you out once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_4,"My ant-friends and I have kicked the butts of everyone you've put in our way. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_5,"Besides, who's ""we""? I don't see anybody else here!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_6,"Tell me, did Stature ever mention there's a version of her here? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_7,With a father who has Pym Particles of his own?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_8,"Time to fight fire ants with fire ants, eh Emma?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_INTRO_9,"Aw, man, not me again!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_START_0,"Jubilee, you've chased me all across the Microverse! A world not your own! Why?!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_START_1,Maybe 'cuz you're a no-good white-after-Labor-Day-wearin' jerk?
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_START_2,"And because it's the right thing to do, DUH!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_0,Emma and Evil Dad are down for the count!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_1,"Phew! Okay, Beast! We're ready to take out the last machine. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_2,"Outstanding. Now, be careful, the Shi'ar actually use micro transistor circuit matrices of distortion to..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_3,"Shoot fireworks into it? You got it, Furball!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_4,ZIPPITY-ZAP! PAM! POP! PAM! POW!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_5,That... also works.
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_6,"Well, you saved the X-Men AND the Microverse? Now can I please take you girls home?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_7,"Sounds good, Mr. Ant. One dimension isn't big enough for how cool I am, anyway. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_8,But Cassie and I are picking the tunes for the ride home!
ID_DIALOG_LE_JUBILEE_07_END_9,"I could swear I was cool once... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_0,"THE PLANET DAEDALUS, YEARS AGO..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_1,"More of Thanos's forces are about to arrive, Adam!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_2,"We need to get these Inhumans to safety, Moondragon."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_3,"Thanos won't stop until he's found the Infinity Gem hidden here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_4,"We can't stop this madman from razing this planet to the ground, but we can evacuate its people."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_INTRO_5,Then we had better move quickly! The enemy is upon us!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_START_0,"Ah, so this world has protectors. But you're not OF this world, are you? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_START_1,"Lord Thanos demands your surrender. And then, as recompense for this resistance, your lives. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_START_2,"I am Adam Warlock, lackey. And I do not surrender. Defend yourself!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_START_3,ADAM WARLOCK'S <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>BLEED</color> TO ENEMIES WHILE EXTENDING THEIR NEGATIVE EFFECTS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_START_4,"HIS <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> CAN DECIMATE ENEMY <color=#fff568>PROTECTORS</color>, WHILE HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>SAFEGUARD</color> TO HIMSELF AND HIS INFINITY WATCH ALLIES."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_0,"Adam, we've gotten as many people as we can free, but Thanos's forces... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_1,"They're not going to stop, I know. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_2,We can't let him get our Infinity Stones. We swore our lives to protect them from exactly this kind of threat.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_3,"You're right. Go. Take your stones, and get far from here."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_4,"What? Adam, we can't leave..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_5,You have to. I'll stand against Thanos and his army to buy you time.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_6,You can't possibly...
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_01_END_7,"I have to. Go. We'll meet again. In another life. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_0,"NEXUS EARTH, TODAY..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_1,"Okay, so, I like totally helped you track down these evil dudes. Can we whomp 'em now?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_2,"Not so fast, Jubilee! I appreciate the assist but Cyclops would kill me if I let you just rush in."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_3,It took us so many clues just to figure out we were LOOKING for the Brotherhood's headquarters.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_4,"We had to unwrap that fake mummy, learn the secret of the old mill, solve the riddle of Professor Crispy..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_5,"And you were in heaven the whole time, Jamie."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_6,"Okay! Yes! I love a mystery. But my point is, we spent all that time getting here, we should be..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_7,Madrox! I have arrived! Just in time for these villains to feel my blade! HAVE AT YOU!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_INTRO_8,"... careful. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_START_0,"Evil mutants! Prepare for your end, as you face..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_START_1,X-Factor!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_START_2,"... Yes, how did you know that?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_START_3,"X-Factor, my name is Phyla-Vell. I need your help."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_START_4,"Uh, nice to meet you? Maybe we can talk after these bad guys finish trying to kill us."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_0,"Phew. Brotherhood wrapped up. Thanks for the assist, I think?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_1,"You can thank me by helping me. The Infinity Watch has lost our leader. No one can find Adam Warlock. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_2,"Oh, missing person? Okay, that we can do. Kind of a specialty of ours."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_3,Where was the last place you saw this Adam guy?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_4,"Daedalus Prime, a planet thousands of light-years from here. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_5,I... see. We mostly stick to the Tri-state area.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_6,"The rest of the Infinity Watch are already there. If you can help, my Quantum Bands can take us there in moments."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_7,"Well, as the last member of the team that hasn't been to the other side of the universe yet, how can I say no?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_02_END_8,We're on the case.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_0,"Welcome to Daedalus Prime, X-Factor. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_1,"Woah. Love the shaved head look. Tres chic. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_2,"... Thank you. As Phyla-Vell told you, this is the last place we saw our leader, Adam Warlock, years ago."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_3,"We feared he'd died here but, when we recently returned, we found no sign of his body. I only sense traces of his soul."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_4,Is... that a thing you can find? We usually check for fingerprints.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_5,Adam Warlock has a special relationship with the Soul Stone. Their energies are intertwined.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_6,"That energy permeates this place. It's odd. We were hoping you could see something we could not. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_INTRO_7,"Happy to help. Let's fan out and see what we can find. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_START_0,I think I found a clue? Are all these ghostly lookin' dudes supposed to be here?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_START_1,"Wraiths! Spirits of the Inhumans that Thanos killed, animated by the Soul Stone energy. We must have disturbed them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_START_2,"Disturbed feels like a pretty good word for it! X-Factor, incoming!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_0,"Rest, spirits. I wish we did more for you, so long ago."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_1,"So long ago... This planet is uninhabited, right? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_2,"Jamie, look at these drag marks over here. These are recent. Someone took something. Something big."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_3,"Phyla-Vell, you do energy... things... right? Can you tell if someone was here?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_4,"I can see it. There's an energy signature heading off-world, different from ours. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_03_END_5,We've got a trail. Let's follow it.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_0,"We're here. Whatever that energy signature was, this planet is where it ends."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_1,"A bold and exciting landscape, a jungle, alien flora and fauna. I sense adventure!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_2,"Yeah, and I sense danger. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_3,Turns out both of y'all are right! You Terrans mind telling me why you're on my damn trail?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_4,"Yondu. I should have known. Whatever you took from Daedalus Prime, we need to know what it was. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_5,"I tell you what, we thought it was a hunk of space junk. But if y'all are desperate enough to follow me to Klyntar for it..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_6,Wait. Klyntar? Home planet of the...
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_INTRO_7,RAAAAARGH!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_START_0,"We were plannin' on grabbing a few symbiotes, seeing if we could train and sell 'em on the black market."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_START_1,"But now, girlie, you'll get to see exactly how valuable these things are firsthand!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_START_2,"Ew, ""girlie""? What are you, like, 1,000 years old?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_START_3,"Old enough to teach y'all some manners! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_END_0,"We're getting our kurtackin' butts kicked, boss!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_END_1,"Get to the ship! We stashed what we found on Morag, we gotta get back there! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_END_2,"If they want that big creepy thing, it must be worth something. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_END_3,Arg! That weasel is getting away!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_04_END_4,"I am, like, COVERED in symbiote goop from this fight! We're totally not giving up now! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_0,THE PLANET MORAG...
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_1,Where are the Ravagers?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_2,"It's a big planet, Madrox. Keep your eyes open, be prepared for anything."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_3,"Anything? Like that super big, super gross thing over there?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_4,"Woah, it's like a big cocoon. This is what the Ravagers took? What IS it?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_5,"It's Adam. He must have regenerated himself into this cocoon state. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_6,"But I can't detect his mind, his soul. It's empty. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_INTRO_7,"Well, I hope that ain't gonna detract from the price none! After all, the new buyers are just about to show up..."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_START_0,"We have to get Adam's body out of here! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_MID_0,"Well, well, here's the big man himself. Once Gamora turned up, I thought you'd be interested."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_MID_1,"You were right, pirate. I am very interested indeed. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_0,"All those years ago, Adam Warlock tried to stand against me and my army. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_1,"Before we could destroy him, he vanished into the ether. Leaving only this.\nThe Soul Stone. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_2,"Wait... The Soul Stone. Of course. Everyone, stand back. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_3,What... What are you doing?! The cocoon...
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_4,It's opening!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_05_END_5,"Thanos! Let this conflict END! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_INTRO_0,"When it was clear I couldn't stop you, I withdrew into the Soul Stone itself."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_INTRO_1,"While my body rebuilt itself, I needed to keep close tabs on you. The Stone was the place to do it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_INTRO_2,"Moondragon sensed it and restored my soul to my new body. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_INTRO_3,"Now you've inadvertently brought me back to this world, Thanos, and I've only grown more powerful. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_INTRO_4,"You face Adam Warlock and the Infinity Watch, demon. Prepare to die!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_START_0,"WHEN THE FULL INFINITY WATCH IS ASSEMBLED, GAMORA QUICKLY LOSES <color=#fff568>CHARGED</color> AND BECOMES <color=#fff568>EMPOWERED!</color>"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_START_1,"EMPOWERED GAMORA DEALS MASSIVE DAMAGE AND APPLIES NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO HER ENEMIES WHILE CLEARING THEIR <color=#fff568>DEATHPROOF</color> STATUS. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_MID_0,"You've been gone for a long time, Warlock. There are corrupted forces in this world now. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_MID_1,"And not all of them will be happy to see you've returned. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_0,"Thanos! Get back here! ... He's vanished, again! "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_1,"No matter, we're just glad to have you back. There's much that you've missed, and questions that we need to answer.  "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_2,"Yeah, what's with the cocoon? Are you, like, a bug guy? Because we've already got a few of those."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_3,"Jubilee! Sorry about her. We're glad we could help your team find you. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_4,Though I've been meaning to ask... Why us?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_5,"The raccoon suggested it. He said you were ""the best detectives he'd ever seen"" and ""real geniuses"". "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_6,"... And I'm guessing you don't have sarcasm on your planet? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_7,Sarcasm? Is that a kind of food?
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_06_END_8,"... Yes, yes it is."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_INTRO_0,"Well, at least we can charge double our normal rate since we left the galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_INTRO_1,"How are we getting home again, anyway? Quantum Bands again? Or are we taking one of those ships?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_INTRO_2,"Ships? What... Oh, no. Those aren't our ships. Adam! A Kree Armada!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_INTRO_3,"I don't know what we've done to anger the Kree, but I didn't return simply to be destroyed by them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_INTRO_4,"X-Factor, your job is not yet done! To our side!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_START_0,"Our masters, the Three Dooms, detected a vast gathering of power."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_START_1,"Surrender it to us, or be destroyed."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_START_2,"Kree and Asgardians working together?! Who are the Three Dooms? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_START_3,"You missed a lot in your bug house, dude! Catch up!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_END_0,"I don't understand. These are the forces of Doctor Doom? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_END_1,"Not Doom himself, but versions of him from other worlds. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_END_2,"They've been waging war on our dimension, and we've yet to stop them."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_END_3,"It seems like they've figured out you're quite a threat, Warlock. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_07_END_4,"Well, if these armies of Doom aren't going to stop, perhaps I should prove them right!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_0,WARLOCK!!! FACE ME!!!
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_1,This Doom seems angrier than the one I recall.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_2,He's from a world powered by gamma radiation. The same thing that created the Hulk.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_3,"He's way, way more deadly than the regular Doctor Doom! If he's here, we're kind of out of options."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_4,"You're right, Madrox. We stand against him, together. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_5,"Ha! Absolutely! Now THIS is leadership, Madrox!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_INTRO_6,"Great, I'm going to die while getting roasted by Shatterstar, just like Destiny said I would."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_START_0,"You've chosen the wrong time to reveal yourself, Warlock!!!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_START_1,"Doom will tear you to pieces! Then, we can continue our plans!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_0,"You can't hold off the three Dooms forever, Warlock!! We will! Crush you!!!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_1,"He's right, Adam. They have an endless number of these green-eyed meanies at their disposal. We can't win today."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_2,I've faced tyrants like these all across the galaxy. We'll have to raise an army to defeat them.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_3,"Nick Fury's already on it. With your power and experience... S.T.R.I.K.E. could stop them for good. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_4,Take me to Nick Fury. I'll hear his plans. Perhaps he'll hear mine as well.
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_5,"Phyla-Vell, return us to Nexus Earth."
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_6,"GREAT. This has been a way deadlier adventure than I was ready for. Jubilee, let's keep this between us, okay?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_ADAMWARLOCK_08_END_7,"Oh, are you kidding? I'm TOTALLY telling Cyclops about this. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_0,"To anyone receiving this, Baron Zemo has infiltrated Omega Red's safe house!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_1,He's stolen the carbonadium synthesizer. He's plan--
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_2,"That's where the transmission cuts off. After that, X-23 goes silent. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_3,"This ain't right.\nI shoulda been with her. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_4,"Laura's an agent of S.T.R.I.K.E., she knew the risks. But we're not just going to leave her behind. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_5,"Besides, whatever Zemo's doing with Omega Red's carbonadium, it's a threat. I'm leading the team myself. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_6,"Where to, sir?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_7,"It's Omega Red's carbonadium. Last I checked, he's locked up--sounds like we need to pay him a visit. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_INTRO_8,Siberia. I'll get the winter gear.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_0,Omega Red. We're not here to fight. We need your assistance. Baron Zemo's taken something of yours.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_1,"And why would I help you Americans? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_2,"Help us stop Zemo and it gets you out of cold storage. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_3,Tempting. But I'd rather go through you than with you!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_4,OMEGA RED STEALS HEALTH FROM ENEMIES TO HEAL HIMSELF WHENEVER HE ATTACKS.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_5,"HIS <color=#fff568>BASIC ABILITY</color> PROLONGS <color=#fff568>BLEED</color>, <color=#fff568>SLOW</color>, AND <color=#fff568>OFFENSE DOWN</color>."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_6,HIS <color=#fff568>SPECIAL ABILITY</color> APPLIES <color=#fff568>TRAUMA</color> AND <color=#fff568>ABILITY BLOCK</color>.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_START_7,"HIS <color=#fff568>ULTIMATE ABILITY</color> FLIPS ALL POSITIVE EFFECTS TO NEGATIVE WHILE APPLYING  <color=#fff568>SLOW</color> AND <color=#fff568>HEAL BLOCK</color>, AND DRAINING THE SPEEDBAR ON ALL ENEMIES."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_MID_0,You done? Or do we need to go a few more rounds?
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_END_0,"Argh, fine. I'll help you track down MY synthesizer."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_END_1,Cooperating now that you don't have a choice? How noble.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_01_END_2,"Take us to whatever facility Zemo broke into. Oh, and Arkady? Don't even think about a double cross. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_0,I repurposed an abandoned factory in Cuba to produce my carbonadium.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_1,"It contained a surplus of the materials needed to make it. Zemo will likely head there first. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_2,"Sir, I don't like this. It could be a trap. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_3,"I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_4,CUBA...
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_5,"Sir, we're at the facility, but it's far from abandoned. I've got enemies on radar. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_6,"Ha, you fools! You've brought me right back to my team!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_INTRO_7,Your team? Not anymore. Zemo sends his thanks for these new recruits and for keeping all this gear warm for him.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_START_0,Just give up. You'll never win.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_0,"Last chance, Arkady. You can head back to the Raft with all these goons who just sold you out... "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_1,"Or you can give up the games and help us find Zemo. I personally don't care which. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_2,"Have it your way, comrade. Here is what I know."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_3,"When you and S.T.R.I.K.E. put me in prison, I was working with a Scientist Supreme to make carbonadium stronger. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_4,"My sources say she is in hiding, near the country Ultron turned into a crater."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_5,"Sokovia? We're not going to be welcome there for sure. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_02_END_6,"That's why she's hiding there. No prying eyes. She's our best bet to find the synthesizer. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_INTRO_0,SOKOVIA...
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_INTRO_1,This place is still a battleground. I thought we were going to help rebuild it?
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_INTRO_2,"Stark tried, but the locals rioted any time he sent help. Hard to make a difference when you're technically an invader. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_INTRO_3,"Can you blame them? You're not always the heroes you claim to be. To them, you are Baba Yaga."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_INTRO_4,There's a massive amount of energy drain coming from below ground. Good chance that's where our girl's hiding.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_START_0,"Monica, we don't want you. We just want Zemo. Where is he hiding?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_START_1,"Sorry, Fury! But I'm more scared of Zemo than I am of you! He's got a weird mask, anything could be under there!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_END_0,"No more tricks, Monica. Where is he?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_END_1,"You don't understand! He's psychotic! He isn't just using the carbonadium on enhanced soldiers, they're also... ARGH!"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_03_END_2,"Sorry, Scientist, but the Baron doesn't like loose lips. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_0,X-23! Stand down!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_1,I don't take orders from you anymore.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_2,"He's done it. He's finally figured out how to use it to completely control his soldiers. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_3,"What are you talking about? Carbonadium's just some knock-off Adamantium, right? "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_4,It's so much more. Scientist Supreme was working on nanotech that could be implanted into carbonadium.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_5,"The nanotech syncs with a Master Mind device. Now anyone implanted is Zemo's to control completely. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_INTRO_6,"Got it. We break that carbonadium and we break control. Let's do it. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_START_0,You're not strong enough to defeat us!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_0,"Laura, what happened? We received your encrypted message, but it was partially destroyed."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_1,"We found Zemo when he caught the team by surprise. We were captured. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_2,"Instead of killing us, he used us as his first living subjects. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_3,Do you remember anything about the facility you were being held in?
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_4,I remember everything.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_04_END_5,Just be ready for a fight. There were hundreds of carbonadium weapons and outfits being made.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_INTRO_0,"You heard X-23's intel. Eyes open. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_INTRO_1,Tavarish Fury! Welcome to die.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_INTRO_2,Baron Zemo has prepared a special suit of carbonadium just for you.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_START_0,"Remember, disable the suits! We don't want to cause too much harm to the people inside."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_0,"Pity, looks like there is still much work to do. To perfect my creations."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_1,Zemo! Hold it right there. I am taking you into custody!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_2,"Taking me? Oh, Fury. I've already started the self-destruct sequence for this facility. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_3,"So you can try to catch me, save the research files, or free the prisoners. But not all three. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_4,"He's right. There's not enough time for us to do everything. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_5,That's why I called in backup. Logan? Your team is a go.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_05_END_6,"At your service, bub. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_INTRO_0,"Carter, Hill, Wilson. You're with me. We need to recover the intel."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_INTRO_1,"Red Guardian, if you're up for it, we need you to free as many hostages as you can."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_INTRO_2,"Wolverine, your team takes out Zemo. He can't be allowed to escape. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_INTRO_3,Won't be a problem.\nWeapon X? Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_START_0,"Ah, the Weapon X project. How... disappointing you all were. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_START_1,Does Fury truly think you failed science experiments stand a chance against me?!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_START_2,The only failure here is you! I'll show you the true power of carbonadium!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_0,My beautiful army! It would have been the Baron's finest work...
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_1,"Weapon X team, what's your status?"
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_2,"Zemo's wrapped up and headed to the Raft. Should keep things quiet for a bit. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_3,What about Omega Red? He still in check?
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_4,"Arkady's still here... Still behaving himself for now. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_5,"Fury! I held up my end of the bargain! Now give me my synthesizer and let me get away from these mongrels. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_6,"About that. You know I can't give you that back, right? What I can offer you, though, is a chance to do some good. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_7,I am Omega Red! Good and evil mean nothing to me.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_06_END_8,But I have nearly forgotten the smell of fresh air. I accept your terms.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_0,"Glad you're on the team, Omega Red, because I have our next mission. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_1,Ant-Man has reported that an evil version of S.T.R.I.K.E. has been spotted in the Microverse.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_2,They're stealing Pym Particles and setting up to wage all-out war against Nexus Earth.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_3,Microverse? Hah! I will squish them like the tiny bugs they are.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_4,"Nexus S.T.R.I.K.E., I soooo hoped we would meet."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_5,I thought you people were\nthe good guys.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_6,S.T.R.I.K.E. rules this world for its own good. We're beyond labels such as good or evil.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_INTRO_7,"And soon we'll be ruling your world, too. Just as soon as we get those Pym Particles."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_START_0,"Hey, this is just like training. Only with swords, guns, and no safety net."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_END_0,"You bought your world a little time, but we WILL get those Pym Particles in the end."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_END_1,"Why are you doing this? We built S.T.R.I.K.E. to protect, not conquerer."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_07_END_2,I'm tired of responding to crises and cleaning up messes. It's so much easier when I'm calling the shots!
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_INTRO_0,"Stand down, Fury! Things don't have to end this way."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_INTRO_1,"Give up the tyranny, leave this planet, and surrender. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_INTRO_2,"Run from a fight? No way in hell. I thought you'd know me better. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_START_0,Team. Let's show these so-called heroes what it's like to be unshackled.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_0,"Looks like your reign of terror ends here, Fury."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_1,Don't worry. There's a special wing of the Raft waiting for you.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_2,You're still fighting the small fights. You have no idea what we were getting ready to fight against.
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_3,"Yeah, yeah. Get him out of here already."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_4,"Bah. Such empty prophecies. There is ALWAYS something bigger to fight against. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_5,"Whatever it is, we'll be ready for it. And part of that means getting your help synthesizing the carbonadium into our gear."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_6,"Fine. You'll see the strength of my carbonadium, as long as I can unleash it on who I please. "
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_7,"Director Fury, our techs finished scouring the would-be S.T.R.I.K.E.'s database."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_8,"One name kept coming up, over and over, but it's not in our records."
ID_DIALOG_LE_OMEGARED_08_END_9,"""Dormammu."""
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_0,THE HELICARRIER\nABOVE S.T.R.I.K.E. HQ...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_1,"Fae energy, spirits of yore, return me to my time and aid my escape."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_2,ARGH! The witch's curse...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_3,"Still holds strong, Morgan. When I bound you here, I warned you about attempting to free yourself. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_4,And yet you must have expected me to try.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_5,You're a sorceress of legend and myth. I'd be disappointed if you didn't.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_6,"Then send me back into myth, Witch. Let me return to my own time, where I belong."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_7,"To craft another Darkhold? You're too dangerous in the past. I'm sorry, but you're here to stay."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_INTRO_8,"Hm. Well, if my salvation isn't in the past... Perhaps it's time I looked to the future."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_0,"O, Mists of Avalon, show me what's yet to come. Show me my salvation... And S.T.R.I.K.E.'s devastation."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_1,Yes... I can see it... A future yet to be...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_2,"MY ANCIENT STRENGTH DORMANT, NOW UNLEASHED"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_3,THIS WORLD BENT TO MY WILL
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_4,"THE STRONGEST RULE, HAVING CULLED THE WEAK"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_5,FIND ME... FREE ME... AND THROUGH MY POWER... FREE YOURSELF
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_01_END_6,Well... It seems I have a way out after all.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_0,"GIZA, EGYPT..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_1,"The being that calls me is here, somewhere."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_2,Finding them would be much faster if I could use the full breadth of my knowledge.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_3,"The Witch and Strange would detect a larger spell... "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_4,Thankfully I know incantations and spells that can do the job while escaping their notice.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_INTRO_5,"But not enough to escape Doom's. Morgana, we must speak."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_0,"Victor. How long has it been? For you, I mean."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_1,"Not long enough. I know what power you seek here.\nPursuing it is reckless. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_2,"S.T.R.I.K.E. has made me desperate, Victor. If you judge what I'm doing so harshly, aid me instead."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_3,Or does my former student hold so much hate in his heart that you'd rather see me in shackles?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_4,"I underestimated Nick Fury and his forces once, Morgana,\n and paid a price for it."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_5,"I have my own plans, and I won't jeopardize them for... sentimentality."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_03_END_6,"Out of respect, though, I will not stop you. But be sure you know what it is you're unleashing. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_0,"The unforgiving desert wasn't easy to traverse... But I've found it. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_1,The great stone temple from my vision.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_2,It's ancient. But the wards around it are much younger. I detect...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_3,Ah. Strange.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_4,"The sorcerer sealed this himself. Probably strong enough to withstand the greatest wizards of his age. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_INTRO_5,"But I am not of this age. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_END_0,Finally... Strange's protections are dispelled. Now to enter...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_05_END_1,"And find my salvation. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_0,"These markings, the magic sealing it, this darkness... This isn't a temple. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_1,"It is meant to be a tomb. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_2,"FREE ME, MORGAN LE FAY"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_3,S.T.R.I.K.E. sought to bury someone in this place. Just as they want to control me.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_4,RELEASE MY POWER
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_INTRO_5,All they've done is arrange their own undoing.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_END_0,"Here it is... The power coming from this sarcophagus is unspeakable. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_END_1,"Only these last spells, keeping it contained. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_END_2,"Easy enough to dispel them.\nWelcome back... En Sabah Nur. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_END_3,"Behold, humanity!\nYour reckoning is finally at hand!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_08_END_4,"Behold the return of APOCALYPSE! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_0,"Who are you, that has freed me from this prison?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_1,You're human. And yet... not?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_2,"I'm so much more. My name is Morgan Le Fay, and I have had a vision of the future."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_3,"A future free from heroes. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_4,"A future with you, En Sabah Nur, at its center. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_INTRO_5,"Show me. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_0,"Through time and space, I saw another world. One in an age without heroes to stop your ascent."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_1,"The natural order.\nHow things should have been. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_2,"And can be. While you were imprisoned, the walls between dimensions were weakened. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_3,"So we can bring that world to ours. But what do you gain from freeing me? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_4,"The same people who imprisoned you have trapped me here. With our power combined, I can be free..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_5,"To exact revenge. Very well.\nMorgan Le Fay, you shall be the first harbinger of what is to come."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_6,"Feel my power coursing through you. Allow it to make you into what you were destined to become. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_MORGAN_10_END_7,And now rise... Reborn as PESTILENCE!\n My HORSEMAN OF APOCALYPSE!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_0,"THE HELICARRIER, S.T.R.I.K.E. HQ..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_1,Hill! What the hell is that screaming?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_2,"It's our psychics, sir. They've been doing this for hours, so we've been trying to sedate them..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_3,No luck.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_4,What triggered it? Are we under attack?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_5,"That's just it, sir. There's no sign of attack, and it's not all of our psychics..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_6,"Just the Mutants. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_7,Great... At least I know who to call in.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_INTRO_8,Get me the X-Men.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_0,"You rang, sugah?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_1,We've got problems. S.T.R.I.K.E. employs trained telepaths as a first line of defense against psychic attacks.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_2,"But suddenly all our Mutants in that division are out of commission. No one knows why. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_3,And I hate not knowing why.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_4,"Ain't no problam there, Fury. Gambit an' ah can get to the bottom of this. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_5,"I'm not ungrateful, but I was hoping for a different X-Men... One with the power of the Phoenix Force. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_6,"Jeanie's off-world with Cyke an' the rest, huntin' down a nasty mess of baddies called Orchis. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_01_END_7,"Right now, me an' Gambit? We're the X-Men you got. And we can handle anything."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_0,"We sure dis is the spot, chere?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_1,"Emma plugged into Cerebro back at the mansion, and she said this is where all that psychic feedback was comin' from."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_2,"Coulda used her help, too. Too bad I still ain't sure if we can trust her. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_3,All we've been through? There's nothin' we can't handle together.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_4,"Besides, once the situation is under control, maybe we see what else we can handle, no?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_INTRO_5,"You're layin' on the Cajun sweet talk a little thick, sugah. Let's head inside and see what we can learn."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_0,"Pst, Rogue. Take a look - I t'ink we found who we've been looking for. A whole mess of dem. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_1,"Listen up, recruits. We've brought you here from all corners of the globe. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_2,"We've been lost since our leader, Ultimus, was banished. We awaited his return... To nothing."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_3,"Today, our wait ends. Today, we gather to serve a new master. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_4,"We have all been tested, and the strongest among us may join us in this new crusade. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_5,"The rest of you, I'm sorry to say... Your path ends here. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_6,*KZZ-ZAAAAAAAP!!!*
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_7,Remy! They're gunnin' down their own! What kinda nightmare is this?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_03_END_8,"We obey only one law now. Only the fittest survive. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_INTRO_0,"Ah know y'all are the enemy an' everythin', but ah'm not gonna stand by and watch people get hurt. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_INTRO_1,"We've got intruders! Get the equipment loaded and evac! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_INTRO_2,"You interlopers can't stop what's already in motion. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_INTRO_3,"Ah, but we do love to try. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_INTRO_4,"Hit 'em low, Remy. Ah'm goin' high!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_0,"Phew! I do love gettin' a workout wit' you, Rogue. Scott an' the others should go away more often."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_1,"Y'all got a one-track mind, Gambit. Right now, ah'm more concerned with what they're buildin' here."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_2,Big brains back at the mansion might know more... Time to call in some backup?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_3,"No time - there's still a whole mess'a these bad guys left and they'll get away. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_4,"'Sides, they don't stand a chance with you and me as a team, sugah. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_05_END_5,"Heh. Dat's the spirit. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_INTRO_0,"More suppressive fire! Take down these Mutants and get our gear loaded onto the freighter! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_INTRO_1,"Lotta these bad guys, chere! Startin' to think our big bet ain't gonna pay off."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_INTRO_2,"That's dang quitter talk! Keep these boys busy, ah'm going after that freighter. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_INTRO_3,"Wait, Rogue, no! Don' let dem split us up!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_INTRO_4,"Too late, Mutant. You're on your own now. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_0,Argh!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_1,"Take a powder, sug'. Remy can handle the rest of y'all while I get a look up here."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_2,This big ol' device must be causin' the psychic feedback. One good whack an' we can put an end to that...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_3,"I'm afraid you're mistaken, child. This device isn't the source of the pain your psychics are in."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_4,"It's me. Or more precisely... "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_07_END_5,Us.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_INTRO_0,"Apocalypse?! Ah ain't sure how y'all got free ah that tomb we stuck y'all in, but you're goin' right back!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_INTRO_1,"One of Xavier's dogs. Again and again, you find yourself in the presence of my greatness. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_INTRO_2,"And yet again... You attempt to deny it. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_INTRO_3,"Come then, child. Feel true power. And tremble before Apocalypse!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_0,Hng... Is that... *cough* All... you got?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_1,"Destroy her, my lord. If she lives, your freedom will be revealed, and the time is not yet right. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_2,"You're right, my Pestilence, of course. She cannot be allowed to tell the others. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_3,But it is a shame to waste such strength. Strength that could be used in service... To me.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_4,"No! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_5,"This one can absorb the power of those she touches, draining them. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_6,Le Fay... Bring her to me. Let her get but a fraction of my power. And her will shall be mine.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_09_END_7,AAAAHHHHHHH!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_0,"You fell as a foe, a tool of my greatest enemy. Rise now as an instrument of my will."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_1,Arise... My <b>Horseman of Famine</b>.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_2,"Ah shall serve you, great Apocalypse."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_3,"I know you shall, child. But not quite yet."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_4,"Pestilence, use your magic. Reach into her mind, and erase this encounter. Suppress her new abilities. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_INTRO_5,I have a specific use for this one.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_0,"You think we can't count to 52, Mutant? You're almost out of cards and hope."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_1,Heh. If you t'ink Gambit ain't playin' with a stacked deck... Den you don' know Gambit.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_2,"But if you're hearin' me, chere, I could use some help regardless..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_3,Y'all talkin' about me? Mah ears are burnin'.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_4,Ain't the only part of you that's burnin' hot. You take care of business?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_5,"Darn right. Ah blew whatever these fellas were buildin' to kingdom come. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_6,"We play cleanup with the rest an' ah recon this is a job well done. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_7,"I told you... Ain't nothin' we can't do together. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_8,"They've gone, my lord."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_9,"Good. They think themselves victorious. But with our agent among them, when the time is right..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ROGUE_10_END_10,Famine will cause S.T.R.I.K.E. to wither and die from within!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_INTRO_0,"Battle stations, Hydra! We are under attack!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_INTRO_1,Fight to the last man! Any who attempt to flee will suffer my wrath.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_INTRO_2,"But sir, the destruction on the outer perimeter... The rumbling... There must be an army out there!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_INTRO_3,"No army, punk. Just me. And I'm more than enough to shake this place to the ground!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_START_0,"Ha! The Americans have sent one of their heroes! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_START_1,"Hero? Son, you're thinking of a very different Hulk. Let me show you what I'm capable of..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_0,"Get your clean-up crew down here, Fury. Another corrupted Hydra base down. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_1,"Clean up? There's nothing left to clean up, Ross. All you left is a crater."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_2,"It's called getting the job done. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_3,"Your JOB was to break through the base's defenses, so the rest of the team could come in and capture the enemy."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_4,Until you flew off the handle and smashed every inch of this place to dust.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_5,"So what? Fewer enemies left to fight. How do you think wars are won, Fury? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_6,"By people following orders. You were a 4-Star General, I'd think you'd be used to that idea. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_7,"I'm used to GIVING orders. And if you had half a mind behind that eye patch, you'd let me give them again."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_01_END_8,"You don't want to listen to me? That's fine. I've got someone you're going to LOVE taking orders from. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_0,You've got to be KIDDING me!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_1,"That's right, Ross. Meet your new commanding officer. Bruce Banner. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_2,"Hello, General."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_3,"You got the Hulk walking and talking at the same time now? You teach him any other tricks? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_4,"Funny. I'm not actually your Bruce. I'm from a world where I managed to merge my intellect with the Hulk. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_5,"I've met Banners from across the Multiverse, Son. ""Smart"" or not, you're all the same. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_INTRO_6,"Then you won't mind working with the rest of us, then. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_0,"Run the simulation again! We're not going on this mission until you're fighting as a team. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_1,"WE'RE good as a team. It's Ross! He doesn't want to work together at all. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_2,"If he pushes me out of the way one more time, I'm going to stick one of those training drones so far-"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_3,"Okay, I get it! Ross, what's the problem?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_4,"Oh, you want to know my PROBLEM?! I spent my career fighting you Hulks! Cleaning up your MESSES."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_5,And now you're in charge? What a joke! I should be running this op.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_6,"From what Fury tells me, you went rogue. Let the Leader turn you into a Hulk. And then did some real damage. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_7,"So maybe Fury doesn't trust your judgment. Maybe it's play nice... Or get thrown in a Hulk-proof cell. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_03_END_8,Fine. I'll do what you say. Just keep the rest of these amateurs out of my way.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_0,OUTSIDE THE MOJAVE DESERT...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_1,"Okay, we're approaching the base now.  S.T.R.I.K.E.'s technicians picked up a spike in Gamma at this location."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_2,"It's big enough that we're the only ones who can handle whatever's going on in there. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_3,"She-Hulk, hit the gate hard. Go full wrecking ball. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_4,"No problem, Cuz."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_5,"Brawn, the doors are titanium. Pry them open as best you can, but use your tech to hack them if needed."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_6,Red Hulk... You're in reserve. Hold back until I give the order.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_7,...Ridiculous.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_8,What was that?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_INTRO_9,"I said, ""Yes, SIR. Brilliant tactics, SIR."""
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_0,"First area, all clear! We definitely set off some alarms, though."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_1,You're giving up the element of surprise AND leaving your best asset in the back!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_2,"Ross, I'm going to need you to just trust me here. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_3,"Listen here! I watched a Banner lay waste to entire towns! Take my daughter from me! "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_4,So I'll be damned if I'm going to trust a Hulk now!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_5,"Out of the way, I'm going in!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_05_END_6,Ross! Get back here!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_INTRO_0,"Okay, big bad! Let's get this over with. Show yourself and take your medicine!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_INTRO_1,"You guys got a Red Hulk in this world, too, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_INTRO_2,"The one on mine was too stupid to know when he was outmatched. I'm betting you are, too. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_INTRO_3,"Outmatched?! Son, I've killed an Abomination before. And I am not likely to stop now!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_INTRO_4,LET'S RUMBLE!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_0,"Pft... That all you got, Blonsky?!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_1,I'm not beat yet...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_2,Heh. Another couple minutes with me and-
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_3,"Stand down, Ross! We're handling this."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_4,Like hell! I've got this! You're just getting in the way!!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_5,I gave you an order!!! STAND DOWN!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_6,You want me to move?! DO IT YOURSELF! RARRRGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_7,RAAARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_8,Bruce! Watch out for the Gamma generator! You're fighting too cl-
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_08_END_9,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_0,Engh... My HEAD... What...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_1,The explosion must have thrown me miles away... I had that fight! UNTIL BANNER!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_2,ALWAYS BANNER!!! RARGH!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_3,"When I get back, I am going to wipe the smug look off his green face... And then Fury after that."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_4,"It sounds like you want revenge. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_INTRO_5,"Or more than that... You want WAR. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_0,Who the hell are you?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_1,"Someone who knows what it is to suffer at the hands of lesser beings. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_2,I was searching for one who can help me destroy S.T.R.I.K.E. and usher in a new era... That's when I found you.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_3,"I was drawn to your rage, Thaddeus Ross. I can feel it burn. And I want to stoke those flames."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_4,Oh yeah? I know a tyrant when I see one. What makes you think I'd help you.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_5,"You can stand beside me as a proud warrior.  Or continue to kneel at the feet of your oldest enemies. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_6,"I... I can't take another order from Banner. He's a true monster, and they hold him up as a hero!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_7,"Well, if it's a monster they want, I'll give them one! I'm in. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_8,Then let my power POUR into yours... Feel it amplify your anger!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_REDHULK_10_END_9,And let your RAGE burn down the WORLD! Arise... \nMy HORSEMAN OF WAR!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_0,"Fury! I warned you! I warned you Apocalypse would return. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_1,"Calm down, Worthington."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_2,"I've been scouring the Multiverse, looking for an Apocalypse that would come for Nexus Earth."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_3,"But somehow, you let the one from our own world rise again."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_4,"I didn't LET anything happen. But you're right, there's a mess.\nA big one."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_INTRO_5,Are you going to stand there pointing fingers or help clean it up?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_0,"Fury's right, Betsy. I need to act, now. And I need you to come with me. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_1,"Warren, Apocalypse's forces are waging war. I know this fight is personal to you, but we have to stick together. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_2,"Personal?! That monster took my WINGS. Of course, it's personal. But that's not why I need to go. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_3,"I know how to stop Apocalypse. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_4,What do you mean? If even Doctor Strange couldn't keep him imprisoned...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_5,"We're not going to seal him away. Or lock him in the Raft. I'm going to kill Apocalypse. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_01_END_6,"And I know just the monster to help me do it. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_0,"What is this place? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_1,Somewhere we shouldn't linger. McCoy! Get out here!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_2,"Ah, Warren. You know, the Angel I knew was a bit more pleasant. Though, he still had his wings."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_3,"Is... Is that Beast? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_4,"Not quite, Elizabeth. Not the one you know, anyway. But perhaps you could get to know me..."
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_5,Enough. You know what I'm here for.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_INTRO_6,"Ah, yes.\nThe Death Seed. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_0,The Death Seed?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_1,A celestial weapon that can kill Apocalypse...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_2,"Or bring about a new one. En Sabah Nur was just the first to receive its gift. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_3,"In your rage, are you willing to risk creating a new monster in the hope of defeating yours?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_4,"I am. And you're coming with me. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_5,"I don't trust you, McCoy. You've been experimenting on this Death Seed. You could have done anything to it. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_03_END_6,"If things go wrong... Well, that's what Psylocke is for. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_0,"How much further to Apocalypse's stronghold? This hostage situation is interminable. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_1,"Not far. Believe me, I want to be free of you as quickly as possible. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_2,"Warren. We need to talk. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_3,"I'm not above getting my hands dirty. But if you want to use me as a weapon? Ask first. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_4,"The only thing Beast cares about is his genius. I needed your psychic powers to scare him into helping us. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_5,"You don't understand. Apocalypse... He was in my head. I know what he's capable of. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_INTRO_6,"To stop him, I would risk everything. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_0,We're here. The sounds of the battle just ahead are unmistakable. How I do miss the screams of home...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_1,"God, he creeps me out. What's the plan, Warren?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_2,"It's not complicated. We get in, find Apocalypse, and end him for good. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_3,"Are you sure this is what you want to do? "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_4,I've never been more... Wait... Something... ARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_5,"Archangel, my greatest creation. Did you truly believe I would not know your mind?"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_05_END_6,You seek Apocalypse...\nYou have found it!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_0,He's in my head!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_1,"Not for long... One psychic barrier, coming up. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_2,Thank you... Now I can think clearly. And END HIM!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_3,"Such a lack of gratitude for the gifts I've given. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_4,"Perhaps my other servants will teach you to accept your place. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_5,"We're surrounded! Psylocke, I'm sorry... "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_6,I know. That's why I already called in backup.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_INTRO_7,"Mornin', shug'!\nBets said y'all need a hand. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_END_0,Rogue... If you hadn't come...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_END_1,"You ain't gotta say it, Warren. We're teammates, ah'm here to watch your back. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_END_2,"Apocalypse retreated. We can't let him leave. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_END_3,The rest of the X-Men ain't far behind.
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_08_END_4,"This can't wait. Come on, we're finishing this monster. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_INTRO_0,"My Archangel. I see you rose above the fray and returned to me. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_INTRO_1,"You gave me these wings.\nHere, have them back!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_INTRO_2,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_INTRO_3,"And he ain't alone. You've been hauntin' my dreams, sugah. I'm here to wake up. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_INTRO_4,"Come, mutants. Let's see if you're fit to survive!"
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_0,"Heh... You've wounded me... Well done. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_1,"Both of you have proven your strength. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_2,"Now... take your places... beside me. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_3,"Awaken. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_4,Wh... What's happenin' to me?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_5,Rogue? What's wrong?
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_6,"Ah'm finally seeing clearly. C'mere, sugah. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_7,ARGH!!!
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_8,"Your will was strong, Archangel. But weakened, you cannot resist my power. "
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_9,Horseman... My harbinger...
ID_DIALOG_APOC_ARCHANGEL_10_END_10,"Arise, DEATH!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_0,DEEP SPACE...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_1,"The Earth defenders have wandered into our star-net! Now, stop them!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_2,"Friend Thor, where did these very bad beings come from?! We were not expecting them."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_3,"It appears to be a trap, small dog! But don't worry, there's one thing they didn't count on..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_4,"Though they've trapped us, we've also trapped them. By being in their trap. See?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_5,"Not sure that one tracks, man. And besides... There's a whole lotta them."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_6,Good thing there were enough of them to draw my attention. Need some help?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_7,"Nova, man! You are just in time, this was about to get gnarly."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_INTRO_8,"Hey, the Nova Corps is always happy to lend a hand. Let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_0,And THAT is how you turn a Kree war fleet into space junk.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_1,"Phew... Gotta say, we could have taken them, but it went a lot faster with the Nova Force on our side."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_2,"Yeah, his blasty things? Way cooler than your blasty things. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_3,"Okay, it's not a competition..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_4,"Thanks. But you guys are a long way from Asgard, or Knowhere, or... Wherever the rock guy is from. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_5,"What are you doing out here, Pete?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_01_END_6,"That's the thing, Richie. We're out here looking for you. Things have changed..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_0,"Wow, I heard Ultimus went down, but Apocalypse returning with an army... This sounds bad. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_1,"Bad is putting it lightly. And Apocalypse isn't sticking to Earth. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_2,"The villain's reach extends to the stars. His foul forces seek something called the Black Vortex. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_3,"Fury figured that if there's a piece of space contraband out here, you'd know where it is, and can help get it."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_4,"The Vortex is bad news. And you're right, I know right where it is. It's on Kymellia III."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_INTRO_5,*BARK! BARK!* Then let us not be waiting one moment more! We must get to it before Apocalypse!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_END_0,"Looks like we got here right in time, man. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_END_1,You weren't kidding about this army. How many guys did we just take out to get planetside?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_END_2,I lost count. But it looks like we're just getting started.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_END_3,Set a perimeter! Don't let them escape! We get the Black Vortex for Apocalypse or lay down our lives trying!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_03_END_4,"Here comes round two. Remind me to thank you guys for getting me into this later. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_0,"Might as well give up, space man. Not that I'd be sad for a reason to give you a taste of my Soulsword. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_1,See this cool space armor? That's because I'm Nova. With the power of the Nova Force flowing throu-
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_2,"Hmm, bored now."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_3,BOOM!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_4,"Uuuugh. Okay, that one's going to leave a dent in the old helmet. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_5,How far did she knock me from the battle? I have to get back...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_6,"Oh, yes, you should definitely return to your friends. They're in an AWFUL lot of trouble. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_7,Who...?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_8,Someone who knows a little something about TROUBLE.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_INTRO_9,Mephisto!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_0,"Flying right back into the fray so quickly? Do all the Nova Corp love to lose, or is this specifically a Human thing?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_1,I seriously don't have time for this. What do you want?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_2,"Little old me? Why, I just want to lend a helping hand. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_3,"Yeah, you're notoriously selfless. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_4,"Well, I didn't say I wouldn't also be helping myself. This Apocalypse business..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_5,It's bad for me. And you and your friends are going to lose. Unless you let me lend a hand.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_6,"With no strings attached, I'm sure. We've faced bigger threats than this before."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_7,"So, if you're done, I'm going to go back and finish the fight. Without you. ""Thanks"" though. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_8,"Well, if you change your mind, I'll be right here, watching Apocalypse's army put an end to you and your friends."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_05_END_9,"After all, I DO love a show! Hahahah!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_0,Friend Nova! You have returned!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_1,"Sorry, there was a sorcerer with a magic sword and a portals... You know what, it doesn't matter."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_2,What's the situation?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_3,"The situation? It's, uh... Bad, man!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_4,The bad guys just got another wave of reinforcements. I don't know how much longer we're going to last.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_5,"If Apocalypse gets the Black Vortex, he can power up his army with Celestial energy. We can't let that happen."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_6,It's too bad we can't just blow the dang thing up.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_7,Wait... Korg! That is a great idea!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_INTRO_8,You're welcome!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_0,Destroying the Black Vortex?\nIs that possible?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_1,"Normally, no! But Stormbreaker is unique! It could overload the vortex!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_2,"True. It is a VERY cool weapon. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_3,We just need to channel a big enough energy source through it!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_4,Like the Nova Force.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_8_END_5,"Precisely! "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_0,Woah... That axe of yours can really take a lot of heat.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_1,"Yes! It was forged in a dying star. Not a big deal. Well, kind of a big deal."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_2,"Hey guys, things are getting pretty hairy out here! How's operation Blow Up The Thing going?!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_3,Friend Nova is working as fast as he can!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_4,"Okay, because, you know... There's a BUNCH of angry Mutants out here!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_5,"Nova, destroying the Vortex...\nThis is possible, yes?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_6,"I can do it, but the amount of energy I'm channelling... "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_INTRO_7,"If we keep this up, it's going to burn out the Nova Force... Forever!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_0,"Star-Lord needs support! We will buy you time! "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_1,Go!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_2,Great... now all that's left is for me to completely burn out one more force for good in the universe.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_3,"No more Nova Force, eh? Seems a shame..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_4,"Not now. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_5,"Sure, you'll stop Apocalypse... For now ... But think of all the helpless people in the galaxy you could help."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_6,Or I could give you just a taste of my power. You could destroy the Black Vortex AND keep on being a hero...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_7,And all I want in return is for you to do what you were going to do anyway.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_8,"...Fine. Do it. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_9,"Done! I'll leave you and your newfound power to destroy the Black Vortex. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_NOVA_10_END_10,And don't worry about explaining this to your friends... It's our little secret. Hahahahaha!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_0,"FISK TOWER, MANHATTAN..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_1,You're bored?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_2,"Yeah! There's all this stuff goin' on! Intergalactic monsters, ancient mutants running around..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_3,And the boss has us on guard duty? Boooooring!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_4,"Kid, I know you're new, but you know how many guys I seen get knocked out by Daredevil?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_5,"Or webbed up by Spider-Man? Don't even get me started on what the Punisher does to guys like us. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_6,Be happy Kingpin just wants us to watch his vault.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_7,"Fine, I get it. I just wish I had a chance to prove myself! Get a little action in!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_INTRO_8,"Well, I've got news, handsome... Turns out, you're in luck. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_0,"Congratulations. You've officially proven yourself. To be what, I have no idea."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_1,"Now, let's see what's in this vault."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_2,Just a few more seconds and I should have it open...\nAlmost... There...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_3,"Felicia Hardy! Your skills are needed. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_4,"And, that's the alarm. Thanks for breaking my concentration, Doc. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_01_END_5,Leave it and meet me at my Sanctum. There's work to be done.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_0,"My, what a big, spooky house you have here, Strange. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_1,"Thank you for coming, Ms. Hardy. Meet the rest of your team. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_2,"Hey, welcome aboard. I'm Photon. This is the Ghost Rider."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_3,HSSSS...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_4,And this is Kama-
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_5,Woah! Black Cat! This is so SO cool!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_6,That's... Enthusiastic. Now can someone please tell me why I'm here?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_7,"Norman Osborn has come into possession of an artifact, the power of which he does not fully understand."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_INTRO_8,"So before he does... We are going to steal it. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_0,I thought Norman joined up with you guys after Ultimus invaded?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_1,"Our Osborn, perhaps. But this one is from another world, and cannot be bargained with."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_2,"So, tell me what he's got and I'll go in alone and take it."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_3,"It's far too dangerous, even for the greatest thief in Nexus Earth. We go as a team. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_4,"Tsk, fine. I'll lead, you get your artifact thing. And we'll figure out what you owe me later. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_5,And if I find a little something for myself along the way?\nWho can say what'll happen.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_03_END_6,"Don't worry... I'll keep an eye on her. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_0,There it is. Oscorp HQ. Normally I'd shimmy in the vents or slice open a window but with this crew...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_1,VENGEANCE...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_2,"I don't know that stealth is an option. What's the plan, Strange?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_3,"Osborn has replaced his security with members of his own Sinister Six. So, thanks to the Images of Ikonn..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_4,"Wait, why do I feel tingly?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_5,...we shall fit right in.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_6,"You made me the RHINO?! "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_INTRO_7,"This illusion should get us inside. Once through, Ms. Hardy, the rest is up to you."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_0,Guess it's time to put these illusions to the test.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_1,Swarm? I thought you weren't supposed to be here for another couple hours?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_2,The boss told me to come early and relieve you. Said you could use a rest.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_3,"He said that? But he was just calling me ""a lazy dolt"" the other day."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_4,And something's different about you...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_5,Uh...Bzz Bzz Bzz?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_6,Huh. Must have been my imagination. Go right in!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_05_END_7,I can't believe that worked.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_0,"We passed those guards just in time, my illusion spell is about to..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_1,Disperse.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_2,"Thank goodness, I've seen enough of Octavius' dreadful haircut for one lifetime. So, what am I stealing?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_3,"Beyond this vault door lies the Empire Stone. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_4,"Its mystic energies bend the winds of fate towards its owner, invisibly building them an unstoppable empire. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_5,"Hey, um, sorry to bug you guys but... Seems like we weren't maybe in the clear?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_6,"I KNEW you weren't Swarm!\nHe's usually meaner to me. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_INTRO_7,"Turns out Shocker's just a smidge smarter than we though. Hold them off, I'll slice my way into the vault."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_0,"Ah, alone at last, inside a massive vault of riches.\nNice to be in my element."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_1,And this little gem must be what all the fuss is about. Sigh.\nTime to get it back to Strange.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_2,"Or... You could keep it.\nAfter all, why shouldn't you?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_3,Who...?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_4,Someone who thinks maybe Osborn isn't the one who deserves an empire.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_5,"With this gem you could build a crime syndicate that would make Wilson Fisk look like a petty thief. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_6,"I admit... I do like the sound of that. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_7,"All you have to do... is take it. After all, it's what you're best at."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_8_END_8,Hmm...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_0,They're still coming! I thought there was only supposed to be six of these guys?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_1,Osborn pulling them from infinite other dimensions does tend to bloat the roster a bit.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_2,You were in there for a long time...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_3,"It's a big vault, lots of goodies to sort through. But I got the stone."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_4,"Great. Hand it over. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_5,My claws are full at the moment! Maybe you can finish mistrusting me after we get out of this?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_INTRO_6,"Oh, I absolutely will."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_0,"Quickly, through the portal back to the Sanctum!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_1,"You all can head back to spook central. I'll find my own way out. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_2,Not with that stone...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_3,"Oh, grow up. Of course I'm giving you the stone. But I'm a solo act, I'm done secret defending. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_4,"Thank you, Felicia. I will not forget this debt. Now, to the Sanctum!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_5,They're gone. You're sure the fake you gave me will fool\nDoctor Strange?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_6,"Oh, Stephen and I have a loooong history. I know all his tricks."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_7,"Enjoy the Empire Stone, Felicia Hardy. Just don't forget where you got it. Hahahaha!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_BLACKCAT_10_END_8,"Now... Let's see what kind of power the cat can drag in. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_0,A SECRET ROXXON FACILITY...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_1,"I'm through the laser grid, and..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_2,"We're in. Welcome to Roxxon's secret weapons lab. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_3,"The boss wasn't kidding, Bobbi. These prototypes are way beyond what S.T.R.I.K.E.'s got. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_4,"Do they have a really big gun?\nI love a really big gun. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_5,If this stuff gets on the streets... We need to blow this place sky high before that happens.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_6,"I'll set the charges. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_7,*INTRUDERS DETECTED. INITIATE HARD LIGHT HOLOGRAM DEFENSES*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_INTRO_8,"Uh, and we'll handle those. Work fast, Coulson. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_0,"I gotta tell you guys, beating up Holograms isn't half as satisfying as real bad guys. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_1,Plus they just keep getting up. What's the status of those explosives?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_2,Ready to blow. Just needed to make sure my 'cool guy' sunglasses\nwere on.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_3,Seriously?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_4,It's all about the details.\nNow let's go!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_5,*BOOM!*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_6,"Mockingbird to S.T.R.I.K.E.! Mission accomplished, the Roxxon lab is rubble. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_7,"Great work, team. Now, return to S.T.R.I.K.E. Headquarters.\nI have a new mission for you."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_01_END_8,"On our way, Director Osborn."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_0,Outstanding work destroying Roxxon. They'll never think to endanger the good people of the Nexus again.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_1,"I'm afraid you can't rest yet. Alchemax is developing a new formula of M.G.H.\n- Mutant Growth Hormone. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_2,"Head to their lab and raze it to the ground. With prejudice. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_3,We're on it.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_4,Clint... Does this feel right to you?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_5,"Taking down bad guys? It's basically the only time I DO feel right. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_6,"Every time I talk to Director Osborn, I can't help but feel like something's... Off."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_7,"I mean, he's dressed like a goblin. But we're teammates with a pile of rocks and a Norse god. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_INTRO_8,"Probably just pre-mission jitters. Come on, Quinjet's leaving. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_0,"Touching down at Alchemax now, Boss. We'll update you when the mission is done. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_1,"See that you do. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_2,"S.T.R.I.K.E. under my control, the Avengers running my errands and taking out my competitors."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_3,"I've made a lot of deals as the head of Oscorp, but this one..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_4,"The power I've always dreamed of, for one measly soul? "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_5,"A bargain at twice the price, Mephisto."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_03_END_6,"Always happy to see a satisfied customer, Norman! HAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_0,WEEKS LATER...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_1,Quinjet Autopilot is telling me our destination is coming up.\nLock and load.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_2,(I've always wanted to say that.)
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_3,"Gather round, kids. I've got updated orders from Director Osborn. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_4,"Updated orders? We're about to take on a bunch of rogue ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, and he's changing the play?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_5,There's new intel and boss says capture isn't an option. We're supposed to take out their leader.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_6,"I read the guy's file, I'm not sure why he's so important. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_INTRO_7,Just some Cold War fossil.\nName's Nick Fury.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_0,"Okay, pal. End of the line."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_1,"""Pal""? Barton, I don't know what you and your crew think you're doing... But you're way off the mark. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_2,"Okay, you know my name. So you also I know I don't miss. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_3,"Say goodbye to the other eye. And everything else. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_4,"Clint, wait. This isn't right."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_5,"We're heroes, we're spies... We're not assassins. Think about it. Why are you even in your Ronin gear? "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_6,"Listen to the woman, Barton. She knows what's really happening."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_7,"Says the guy with a sword pointed at him. Bobbi, I trust you more than anyone - what's the play here?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_05_END_8,"We hear him out. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_0,"Ah, my best team, returned triumphant. Status report."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_1,Target's eliminated. Ready for the next mission.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_2,"Wonderful. At ease, soldiers. Get some rest, you've earned it. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_3,"...Okay, he's gone. Make it quick, though - Osborn's not exactly predictable."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_4,We got you in. Time to show us whatever it was you promised would clear this up.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_5,"It's the least I could do after you so kindly chose not to assassinate me. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_INTRO_6,"Hellicarrier? Level 10 Access - Fury, Nicholas J. Unlock all files related to Norman Osborn."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_0,"Here you go, all the files on Osborn. Take a look."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_1,"There's... Nothing? There's not a single scrap of information about Director Osborn here. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_2,"That's because he's not real. Not ""Director Osborn"" anyway. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_3,"Three months ago I woke up and I wasn't in charge anymore. And the Green Goblin was sitting in my chair. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_4,"Why can't we remember that? And why can you? "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_5,"Sadly, those are questions you'll take with you to the grave. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_8_END_6,"You see, the punishment for treason is DEATH!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_0,"I'm not sure how you still remember, Fury, but it's nothing a few pumpkin bombs can't knock out of your skull!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_1,"You think you're the first megalomaniac to try and re-write history? We have a Thanos on the payroll. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_2,"My memory's protected by mutant psychics, mystical wards, and by being the smartest man in the room. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_3,"I can't believe I was taking orders! Just, like, in general.\nExtremely not me. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_4,"Maybe next time you'll listen to me. Now, though, we get to work our frustrations out on Osborn. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_5,Mephisto!\nThis was not part of the plan!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_INTRO_6,"Oh, I think this is going EXACTLY according to plan."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_0,"We had a deal! I give you my soul, you give me power!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_1,"We did. And you got exactly as much as your soul was worth. The entire blackened, withered thing. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_2,"It's not my fault if your sins got in the way of my perfectly good spell. Sorry, Norman! No refunds."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_3,"I will find you, devil.\nI will have my revenge!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_4,"Well, if you're so unhappy, I'll just set things back to how they were."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_5,No!!!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_6,*SNAP*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_7,"I... I remember everything! Uh, sorry about the sword thing, Fury. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_8,Get the Goblin and we'll call it even.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_GREENGOBLIN_10_END_9,"Too late, he's gone. Mephisto too. But I know for sure... This isn't over."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_0,THE WASTELAND...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_1,"Okay, kid, make it quick. Why'd you drag these strays to my doorstep?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_2,"They're not strays, they're CLIENTS. They need a way off world, and we said you can help."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_3,"Well, give 'em a refund, 'cause I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm retired. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_4,I'm planning on sitting on this ranch and drinking until I forget we ever had this conversation.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_5,"Wow, Logan, you've changed. Wait, no... This is exactly how I remember you. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_6,"Change is for people with somethin' to change for, kid. But, this debate club's gonna have to wait..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_7,*sniff sniff*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_INTRO_8,You led raiders right to me!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_0,"Well, I'm definitely not telling M.J. that May was around that level of violence."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_1,"My advice? Tell the kid to get used to it - violence is the one thing this place has got in spades.  "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_2,"Wow, you know, I said you're the same, but I guess I was wrong. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_3,"The Logan I knew was a drunk, and had a temper, and, sure, didn't smell GREAT..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_4,You gettin' to a point any time soon?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_5,"But he'd never turn down people who needed his help. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_6,"Grr... I forgot how much your speeches bugged me. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_01_END_7,"Fine. I'll help. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_0,"I can repair Sp//dr's tech to get us home! But we haven't been able to find an energy source strong enough. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_1,:-(
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_2,"Energy... Yeah, there's a place out in Utah that's got plenty of that. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_3,Nowhere in this wasteland's got plenty of ANYTHING without a catch. What's between us and the payday?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_4,"The energy? It's Gamma. And you know what that means. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_5,"Banners. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_6,Wait... BannerS? PLURAL?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_7,"Yeah, the Hulk's kids. Some smart, some... Less so. If there's a Gamma Plant, it's probably the smart ones."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_INTRO_8,"You wanted my help, kid? Well, you're gonna need it. Grab your gear, we're leavin' now."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_0,"Hey, Logan... I'm sorry if I was a little harsh back there. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_1,"The smell thing was a little over the line, I mean I've got someone in a diaper strapped to my chest. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_2,"I've got enhanced senses, bub - you don't gotta remind me."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_3,So... Do you want to talk about it? Whatever happened to you?
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_4,Nope.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_5,"Ooookay, well, good talk. I see the Parker Charm works no matter what universe I'm in..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_6,"All you need to know is that a long time ago, some bad guys used me to hurt a lot of people I love. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_7,I'm never letting that happen again.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_03_END_8,And I ain't gonna let that happen to any of you. Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_0,"We're here... All the Gamma energy you need, just behind those concrete walls. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_1,*RUMBLE*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_2,"Oooh, thunder! Or is that the Wasteland rest stop Mexican food I had on the way here..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_3,"There ain't a cloud in the sky, Wade."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_4,Please tell me it's not his stomach...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_5,Worse. Footsteps. Belonging to...
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_INTRO_6,"Well, well, well. Looks like we've got some TRESSPASSERS. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_0,*WHAM*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_1,This is the guy that gave dad all that trouble back in the day? He's so... Small.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_2,"*spit* Heh... Yer pop used to slug me ten times harder, and was smart enough to know he needed to."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_3,"No brains or brawn... Tough luck ending up with just his looks, bub. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_4,"Hey, are we sure making them ANGRIER is the right move? Are Hulks different on your world or something?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_5,"We're going to pick our teeth with your metal bones, old man!\nRAAAGH-- "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_6,*PEW PEW PEW*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_7,ARGH!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_05_END_8,"Hands off the little hairy guy! Not the raccoon, I mean... The little GUY... You get it!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_0,"Thanks for the assist, Quill. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_1,"Yeah, well, next time you call in a favor, you could mention that it's green and can lift ten tons."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_2,"And ruin the surprise? "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_3,"Spidey, you're a sight for sore eyes. It's been a few light years since we've seen a hero like you around here."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_4,"It's funny you say that, light years are ACTUALLY a measurement of distance!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_5,"...Still a nerd, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_INTRO_6,"You don't know the half of it. Quill, you and Rocket keep 'em occupied. I'm getting these spiders a ride home."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_END_0,"Hate to admit it, but it's good to see you up and back in action. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_END_1,"Heh, I didn't think you gave a damn about your old man, kid."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_END_2,I don't... Not the one who sits in his shack moping about the old days.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_END_3,"But when you have something to fight for again, keeping your old friends alive..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_8_END_4,"I'm seeing a little of The Wolverine everyone's always telling me about. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_0,"Mr. Wolverine! I'm connecting Sp//dr to the Gamma Core now! Once he's powered up, we're good to go."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_1,:-)
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_2,"You really helped us out, Logan. We'll always owe you our duck. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_3,"Pete, you're making less sense than normal."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_4,"No, DUCK!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_5,*WHAM!*
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_6,"You should have stayed retired, pipsqueak. My idiot brothers couldn't handle you... "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_INTRO_7,...Let's see how you do against ME!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_0,Sp//dr's portal is open! We can go!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_1,"Make it quick! She-Hulk's getting back up. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_2,We need to stop her before she talks to the camera again! That's my thing!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_3,"You don't need to tell me twice. Spiders, let's go!"
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_4,"S.T.R.I.K.E. HQ, NEXUS EARTH..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_5,They're back! Close up that portal and get some damned support in here ASAP.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_6,Fury! I can't tell you how good it is to see myself reflected in that shiny head again!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_7,"Please don't make me consider sending you back. "
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_8,"No way, bub. They did enough damage."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_9,Logan! You came with us?!
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_10,Felt good fighting for something. I remembered what Charles Xavier's dream meant. Figure I'll lend a hand.
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_11,"I can always use another set of claws. One question, though..."
ID_DIALOG_TRIALS_OLDMANLOGAN_10_END_12,Who the hell is Charles Xavier?
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_UNDERWORLD_1_INTRO_0,The Kree are abducting my associates and converting them to their cause.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_UNDERWORLD_1_INTRO_1,I'm sure whoever rescued would be willing to join S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_0,We're getting reports of Elektra running rampant in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_1,"Daredevil, work with the Commander on this."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_START_2,I'll take a team and track her down.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_0,"Elektra, the senseless killing has to stop."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_1,"Murdock, you fool. It's not me. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_2,"Someone is committing crimes in this city while wearing my face. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_3,"I was closing in on the imposter when you jumped me. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_4,"That explains a lot. We have a common enemy. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_5,"If we help you with the imposter, will you help us stop the one she works for?"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_1_END_6,Gladly.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_2_START_0,The impostor is headed this way... and it looks like she is not alone.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_2_START_1,There are a lot of imposters floating around these days.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_0,The likeness is uncanny. What sort of magic is this?
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_1,No magic. I am YOU. Just empowered by my newfound faith... and deadlier.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_START_2,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_0,The imposter was NOT my equal in strength and skill.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_1,Fury says these corrupted versions of us are weaker than the ones from our dimension.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_2,So we work for Nick Fury now?
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_3,"Working together is the only chance we have of defeating this threat. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_4,"Very well. But don't expect me to wear a badge. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_3_END_5,Wasn't even going to suggest it.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_0,The Elektra imposter was working to corrupt the Hand Ninja Clan to the invaders' side.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_1,"If they take control of the Hand, they will have an army of ninjas at their side."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_2,Nobu is the Hand's leader. That's who they will try to replace.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_START_3,Then we have to get to him before they do.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_END_0,Our only chance is getting to Nobu before they replace him with a corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_4_END_1,Then follow me.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_0,"You enter my domain unannounced, ninja."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_1,"No time for formalities, Nobu. You are in danger. Imposters are attempting to--"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_2,"If you are referring to our new friends, the Kree, then I believe you are too late."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_START_3,They've already corrupted you. Then we do this the hard way.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_END_0,Nobu has been corrupted. We have to take out the entire clan.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_5_END_1,Better get to work.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_0,"The Immortal Iron Fist, you are sworn enemy to the Hand. Now you fight with them?"
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_1,"The Hand, the Fist, and the Devil fight for a new leader now."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_START_2,Then you must be put down as well.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_END_0,"There is someone else guiding the Hand. Someone pulling Nobu's strings. "
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_6_END_1,Our true enemy has yet to reveal himself.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_0,I sensed that a corrupted version of myself might be behind this.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_1,Deep down you know this feels right. You just always let your conscience get in the way.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_2,You know I won't let you get away with this.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_START_3,I already have. The New York Hand belongs to me now. And I answer to another.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_0,I doubt that is the last we will see of your corrupted version.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_1,"Probably. And as long as a corrupted Daredevil rules the Hand, he runs New York City."
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_2,We have to find a way to regain control of the Hand.
ID_DIALOG_ELEKTRA_EVENT_7_END_3,I think I have an idea...
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_0,We're getting reports of a bank robbery in Midtown. Take a team and check it out.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_1,A bank robbery? Really? While there's an interdimensional alien invasion going on?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_2,Crossbones is involved. He was one of the first Hydra agents to work for the invaders.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_START_3,It's important.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_0,Aren't you supposed to be plotting world domination instead of robbing banks?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_1,"I don't work for our invaders anymore. They double-crossed me. All of Hydra, for that matter."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_2,Their brainwashing commando squad should be showing up to kidnap me any minute now.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_3,Here's the deal: I'll join S.T.R.I.K.E. and help you fight against them if you protect me from their commando squad.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_4,Give me one good reason why I should trust a backstabbing Hydra mercenary like you?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_5,"Only one? For starters, I know a lot about your enemy's operation. Codes, procedures, transport sites..."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_6,And you know I pack a mean punch.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_1_END_7,Let's get you some security clearance.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_START_0,"Okay, I joined your S.T.R.I.K.E. Force. Now you guys have to protect me from this brainwashing kidnap squad."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_START_1,"A deal is a deal. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_0,Alright. You're safe. Now tell us everything you know about the invaders.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_1,Give me a second... I gotta get used to the idea of being a good guy.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_2,You are NOT a good guy. You're just the lesser of two evils.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_2_END_3,Wow. You really know how to make a guy feel special.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_0,The invaders' first step is to ally with evil organizations and get them to abduct heroes.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_1,They trap the heroes in those orbs and send them through the portals for corruption.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_2,"Let me guess: Then they double-cross the bad guys and convert them, too."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_3,"Yeah. They left that part out of the initial sales pitch. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_START_4,"So now we're going to intercept a shipment of orbs as payback. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_0,Now we just follow the trail back to the warehouse where they are sending these orbs through the portal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_1,"You're actually enjoying this, aren't you?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_2,Screwing over the guys who promised me the world and then tried to brainwash me?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_3_END_3,Yeah. I'm enjoying this.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_0,This is one of the black sites for Ultimus's kidnappers. Looks like they didn't relocate.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_1,Perimeter breach! Alert!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_START_2,Payback time.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_0,"Inside is usually where they keep the portal that they send the orbs through. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_1,And on the other side is where they put them through the Conversion Process?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_4_END_2,Yep. And what comes back is completely loyal to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_0,"Crossbones. They told me you had tried to run. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_1,Thanks for saving me the trouble of having to pursue you.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_2,"That's me. Mister Helpful. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_START_3,"While I'm here, mind if we completely destroy your operation?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_0,"Damn, that felt good. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_1,"Korath is always running his mouth about ""pursuing this"" and ""pursuing that."""
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_2,Now the only thing he is pursuing is my fist!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_3,That makes no sense.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_5_END_4,Doesn't matter. Still felt good.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_0,Only thing left to do is get in there and smash the portal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_1,Then Ultimus can't receive captured heroes in orbs and convert them.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_2,Exactly.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_3,"Except for the dozens of other portals he's set up around the world. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_4,"Well, at least it's a start."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_START_5,"You really are a ""glass half full"" sort of girl."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_NEBULA_0,"You didn't really think you could just march in here and destroy our portal, did you?"
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_NEBULA_1,Of course not. We planned on beating you up first.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_0,"Heads up, Latex. A corrupted version of Red Skull will be guarding the portal."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_1,The Head of Hydra. Is that going to be a problem for you?
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_2,Not at all. I've thought of punching the REAL Red Skull in the face many times.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_3,Beating up an Ultimus-controlled puppet version is close enough.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_6_END_4,I'm starting to enjoy working with you.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_0,Crossbones. You have betrayed Hydra and Ultimus for the last time.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_1,Fine by me. Wasn't really planning on betraying you guys TWICE.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_2,You shall pay for your betrayal.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_3,"You got it all wrong, Red Cheeks. "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_4,It's YOU who's going to pay. With my FIST!
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_START_5,You really have to work on your comebacks.
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_0,"Smell that, Red? Sweet revenge. There's nothing like it."
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_1,"Can you even smell through that mask? "
ID_DIALOG_CROSSBONES_EVENT_7_END_2,Don't spoil the moment.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Agents of S.T.R.I.K.E., it looks like we have another problem brewing in New York."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,"New York. You mean ""The City That Never Sleeps Because It's Always Under Attack?"""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,"We're already following the trail of destruction. Thanos has arrived, but what does he want? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,"I believe he sees Ultimus as a rival and seeks to destroy him. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,Thanos versus Ultimus? We should just let them fight it out.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"It's true that Thanos is one of the few beings who rivals Ultimus in power. However, the collateral damage would be devastating. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,"We'll have to deploy a team to lure Thanos out of the city. Parker, do you copy?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,"Special Agent Peter Parker reporting from the scene, sir! I'll try to get his attention."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"Deploy a team to slow down Thanos, or at least to lure him out of the city. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_0,"Hey Purple Reign, could I get you to take this thing outside? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_1,"And by outside, I mean, not on my home planet?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_2,"Be gone, insolent child. I will not yield until Ultimus lies broken before me. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_START_3,"Commander, I don't think he's interested in a team-up. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_MID_0,Ultimus! Stop hiding behind these pathetic mortals. Face me!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_MID_1,"Mad Titan, I welcome the challenge."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_END_0,"Thanos, without your precious Infinity Stones, you are no match for me. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_01_END_1,You need a lesson in humility. Perhaps if I exile you to another dimension you will come to know your true station in the grand order.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,"I think Thanos is waking up. Don't be mad, big guy, but I have some not-great news for you..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,"We've been captured by Ultimus, sent to another dimension, and trapped in a Kree Prison ship with Star-Lord and Gamora. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,"A temporary setback. If Ultimus thinks this paltry vessel can hold Thanos, he is sorely mistaken."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,"Gamora, does this egomaniac always refer to himself in the third person? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,"You do that, too. Constantly."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_0,"Once I free myself from this ship, I will locate the Reality Stone and use it to return to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_1,"Thanos, we're trapped here together. For now, we're your only allies. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_START_2,So it seems. Let us see how well you were trained in THIS dimension.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_0,"Excellent, we have taken control of the ship."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_1,"Yeah, but you damaged the primary flight controls!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_02_END_2,"Hold on, everyone! I'll try to make this landing a little less crashy!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Any landing you can walk away from, right? So, what's the next step to getting us back to our dimension, Captain Titanic?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,"The Infinity Stones. If I can find the Reality Stone in this dimension, I can use it to open a gateway. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,"I know the unique quantum wave signature of the stone. Find me a multiphasic tetraplex scanner. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,"Oh, that's all? A powerful scanner like that is incredibly rare. There's only one in this quadrant. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,"Sounds like we need a new ship. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_INTRO_5,"I saw a starport in that direction before we crashed. Let's take out the guards and find a ship. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_START_0,"There's the starport. There's a suitable ship on the launch pad. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_START_1,Spidey-Sense tingling. The guards have spotted us!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_MID_0,"You ain't gettin' anywhere near that spaceship, Bub! "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_MID_1,Ultimus wants your heads.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_0,"They've raised the alarm. We will crush their guards and see them driven before us. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_1," ...Wow. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_2,"Peter, can you create a diversion so we can get inside?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_03_END_3,"You know it! See you on the flipside. And Gamora... be careful. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Star-Lord drew off most of the patrols, but we'll still have to get past the perimeter guards. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"Let them come. I will leave their broken bodies behind as a message to Ultimus. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_START_0,You think you can take on ALL of us? Who do you think you are!?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_START_1,"I am Thanos, the Last Titan... And this day will be your last. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_0,"Your cruelty serves you well, as ever. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_1,"My cruelty forged your strength. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_04_END_2,"I was trained by the Thanos of this dimension, not by you. Ultimus vanquished him long ago. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,"Hey corrupted Yondu and corrupted... uh... me... Can we maybe just borrow your ship? "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,"Boy, you got some stones on you. Ain't nobody getting on my ship without my say-so. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,"How about a showdown? You win, you get the ship. We win, we get Thanos in chains."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,I can take you both alone.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_INTRO_4,"That wouldn't be sporting, would it? Choose a partner."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_START_0,"Alright, kiddo, let's show 'em what we're made of."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_START_1,"You got it, pops."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_FAIL_0,Some tough guy you turned out to be.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_END_0,"Pitiful whelps. They never seem to learn. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_05_END_1,Hey! I resemble that remark.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,Sensors are detecting the multiphasic scanner on the world below. Energy readings are off the charts.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,"I need access to the central control capsule if I am to locate the Reality Stone. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,"I'll set us down out of range of their guns. I don't feel like crashing again. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Do as you must, fragile human."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_END_0,"This planet's defenses are pathetic. Ultimus shows no end of hubris. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_06_END_1,"The scanner isn't far from here. It will be more heavily guarded.  "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_START_0,"Loki, look at these fools. They think they can harbor a fugitive without retribution. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_START_1,"Well, at the very least, they ought to provide us with some degree of entertainment."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_07_END_0,"There was a time when it meant something to be a god. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_0,"At last, the central controls. Step aside, tin toy, or be crushed beneath my boot. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_1,"Don't think so, Thanos. I'm willing to sacrifice everything for Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_2,"Stark, seriously, don't mess with this guy. He has a flying golden throne. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_3,Yeah? So does M.O.D.O.K.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_INTRO_4,Ouch!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_08_END_0,At last. We shall now return home and exact our revenge on the usurper.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_0,Not one step further.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_1,"Nebula, you disappoint me in every dimension, it seems. You would serve that false idol and fight with these peons?"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_2,"I learned the power of Ultimus when he destroyed the Thanos of this dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_3,"And now I will see you defeated yet again... ""Father."""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INTRO_4,"So, I am forced to break you once more. Such a shame. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_START_0,All that's left is to enter the control capsule and locate the Reality Stone. Then we return to the Nexus dimension.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_START_1,I will focus the array while Thanos searches for the Reality Stone's signature.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_1_0,"The control capsule is online. I can already feel the energy coursing through me.  "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_2_0,"I'm reaching out, but I cannot feel the Reality Stone. More power!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_0,"The power... I can feel it... flowing through me... my strength, it... wait... NO..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_1,Something is wrong. Let me try to regain control.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_INFO_3_2,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_FAIL_0,We've lost our Operator. We need to regroup.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_0,AGH!!!  GRAAAH!!!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_1,No! The system shut me out!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_2,Uh... what just happened?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_09_END_3,Thanos is mine.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_0,"Thanos, you have made this all too easy. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_1,"I knew you would be drawn to the promise of power. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_2,It was the only way I could lure an Eternal like you into my Conversion Engine.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_3,"And in one stroke I have eliminated a threat and gained an invaluable weapon. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_4,YES. I CAN FEEL THE POWER COURSING THROUGH ME. ALL HAIL ULTIMUS!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INTRO_5,"Looks like I found you just in time. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_0,Doctor Strange! How did you find us?
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_1,I tracked your life essence across the Plains of Phlogiston.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_2,"Right. Well, whatever else you have up your sleeve, now's the time."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_START_3,"If you can hold off Thanos, I think I can open a portal back to our dimension."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_1_0,By the Ruby Rings of Raggadorr...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_2_0,By the Mystic Moons of Munnopor...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_0,By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_1,"Did he just say ""Hoary?"""
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_INFO_3_2,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_FAIL_0,THERE IS NO ESCAPE. I WILL CRUSH YOU IN THE NAME OF ULTIMUS!
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_0,"By the Fangs of Farallah, we do implore ye passage through..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_1,YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN. ACCEPT YOUR FATE AND SUBMIT.
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_2,"Strange, let us come with you. Thanos cannot be saved. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_3,"Follow me and I'll deliver you to safety. Quickly, through the gateway!"
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_4,"Looks like this is good-bye for now, Purple Haze. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_5,"Just wanted you to know, even though it ultimately ended horribly for you..."
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_6,With you getting corrupted and now controlled by Ultimus...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_7,"For the briefest of moments there, when we were fighting all those Ravagers... "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_8,I almost considered you...
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_9,"A friend. "
ID_DIALOG_THANOS_EVENT_10_END_10,"Psych! Just kidding! Later, you maniac!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Hello there, friend."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,It's me! Your friendly neighborhood merc with a mouth... Deadpool.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,Today you're in for a treat. I'm giving you exclusive access to a new game I made called...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,Deadpool's MARVEL S.T.R.I.K.E. Force.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_4,"What does the S.T.R.I.K.E. stand for? I'm glad you asked. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_5,"Superhero... Tyrannosaurus... Ridonculous-- No, Retrograde... never mind. It's top secret."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_6,Let's get to the story.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_7,"Once upon a time, a big blue alien named Ultimus invaded Earth and left a trail of destruction that laid waste to one man's most beloved eatery..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_8,"That place was Mauricio's Chimichanga Emporium. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_9,"That man was me. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INTRO_10,"I will have my revenge, and it will be EXTRA SPICY."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_0,"Hey, faceless minion! Bad news for you, buddy. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_1,"I came here to kick red-eyed butt and eat chimichangas, and I'm all out of chimichangas. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_2,Is that Deadpool? I heard you were dead!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_3,Only on the inside.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_4,"Sadly for YOU, I survived the blast that took the life of my most cherished chimichanga restaurant."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_5,"And let me tell you that nothing hurts more than boiling salsa deep inside a third degree burn. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_START_6,Except maybe what I'm about to do to YOU.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_0,"Well, that was FUN. Tell me what you were doing here, or I'm gonna kill you even harder."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_1,"If you're looking for that mutant we captured, you're too late. He's probably being stuffed into an orb right now. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_MID_2,The plot thickens!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_1_0,"Looks like the merc convoy is about to leave, but they're setting up a bomb to cover their tracks. Not on my watch!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_2_0,Pro-tip: Use my Special Attack and you'll be able to take out that naughty boy that's trying to arm the bomb.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_3_0,"Wait, are you on AUTO PLAY? Use my Special Ability! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_FAIL_0,Vengeance will be mine! I swear on Thor's bulging biceps!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_0,"You done good, boss. We took down all those mercs without even breaking a sweat."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_1,"I'm definitely bleeding, but no sweat."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_01_END_2,Let's make like Quicksilver and follow that convoy.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,Wasn't it great getting to beat the crap out of a bunch of bad guys using my Basic and Special Abilities?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,Now you get to put on my big boy pants and use my Ultimate Attack.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,"We're gonna fight a bunch of goons on a classic New York rooftop, and then find out who they captured..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,"And Bullseye's gonna be waiting for me and he's gonna be angry for some reason. High drama, there."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,Let's go rescue a hostage!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_0,"It is I, the one and only Deadpool. I am here to save the damsel in distress from the clutches of EVIL."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_1,We've been waiting for you.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_2,"Bullseye said to kill you before you talk us to death. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_3,"I would respond with some pithy comment, but that would just be proving your point."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_4,So instead I'm just going to stand here silently in my idle pose looking menacing and--
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_START_5,"Oh, I see. It's swords for you, mister!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_0,"Finally, a real challenge. Bullseye, baby!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_1,"If I cut off your head, does your body regrow from there, or do you grow a new head on your headless body?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_2,"Both. I'm an asexual organism. Science, kids. Stay in school."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_MID_3,Let's test that theory!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_0,BOOM. Now THAT is how we DO it.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_1,"Joke's on you, funny man... the hostage is in another warehouse."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_02_END_2,"What?! Do I look like an Italian plumber to you? Now I have to start all over! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,"Logan, Deadpool is wreaking havoc in the streets."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,The last thing we need is a wild card like him running rampant.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,I'll track him down and find out what he's up to.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,"Try to bring him in. He'd be a valuable asset. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,No promises.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_0,Wolverine? Here? What a surprise. I am SHOCKED.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_1,"Quit your yammering, Pool. What are you doing out here roughing up corrupted mercs?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_2,"Outta my way, fuzzy and furious. I've got heroics to do."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_3,"Stand down, or I will put you down. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_START_4,You are the world's least friendly Canadian. But since you insist...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_0," **** **** **** *********** ******* **************!!!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_1,"Wow, strict language filters in this game. What I meant to say was..."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_2,Ow.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_3,"Fury wants me to bring you in, bub."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_4,"I was THIS CLOSE to rescuing whoever these goons were transferring to Ultimus. \nNow look at us... "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_5,"Hmmm... Something doesn't smell right. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_6,"I'll help you, but you have to stop this rampage. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_7,"I take back everything I ever said about you in the last five minutes! "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_03_END_8,"Let's go, friendo!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Oh my gosh, I've been looking forward to this team-up for years. Deadpool and Wolverine. YES."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,"So, what is all that fancy S.T.R.I.K.E. tech telling you about this crime scene? "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_2,Running scan data against S.H.I.E.L.D. records now...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_3,ENHANCE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_4,This can't be possible. It's the Techno-Organic Virus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_INTRO_5,What a twist! Only Cable carries the T-O Virus. Let's go rescue him!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_START_0,"Oh man, those flaming red eyes are fierce! LOVING IT."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_START_1,"You're too late, human. We've already extracted the Techno-Organic Virus. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_0,I've seen this tech before. Ultimus uses it to corrupt people into slaves.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_1,"So? It's not like he's gonna use the Techno-Organic Virus to corrupt people with a contagious, self-replicating... "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_2,Oh. Oh crap.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_04_END_3," 'Nuff said."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,Looks like Cable is being held in this warehouse.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,"If we move in silently, we could--"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,HEY CABLE! YOU IN THERE?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,Never mind.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_START_0,"Spider-Man. OMG OMG OMG! Well, evil Spider-Man. I love you, but I have to eviscerate you to free Cable."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_START_1,Sorry.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_0,"Cable, we're here to rescue you!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_1,Too late. They've pulled a sample of the Techno-Organic Virus from my blood. They need to be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_05_END_2,"All the more reason to put that big 'ol gun of yours to use. Lock and load, big guy."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,"Long time, no see, Captain Grumpypants. What in the ever-loving heck is going on here? "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,"In my future, Ultimus failed to conquer Nexus Earth, but that future isn't certain."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,I came to this time to disrupt key moments of victory for Ultimus in hopes of preventing a darker future from materializing.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_3,"Ultimus was waiting for me, then extracted a sample of the Techno-Organic Virus from my system."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_4,Looks like I just made things worse by coming here.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_5,"Wolverine and I are the two best Weapons X ever. We got you, brother!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_INTRO_6,"We need to destroy the samples of the T-O Virus they took from my blood and torch the whole operation. Let's move. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_0,The corrupted Techno Virus is being stored in this armory up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_1,Follow my lead and we'll have the advantage.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_2,"Kids, this means that with Cable on your team, your squad will start with their speed bars partially filled! Wowzers!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_START_3,"Looks like they've just got a bunch of ninjas, a magician, and a couple of Norse gods guarding the place. Easy peasy!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_END_0,That was messy. For me I mean. It's gonna take me a few minutes to re-inflate here.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_06_END_1,"Hurry it up. If this virus is merged with Ultimus's corruption tech, there will be no future left to win."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_0,My sensors have confirmed that the corrupted Techno Virus supply is up ahead.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_1,Looks like Thanos is guarding it. He's corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_2,"Deadpool, Fury will pay you handsomely if you deliver Thanos to us alive."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_3,Handsome is my middle name.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_INTRO_4,"One Thanos, comin' right up!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_0,Deadpool and Cable. These will be the final moments of your insignificant lives.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_1,"Hey Cable, does this guy look familiar to you? Look real close. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_START_2,"Alright, let's dance."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_END_0,"One Thanos, as ordered, AND the Techno-Virus samples are torched."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_07_END_1,"Admit it... We're awesome. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_0,"Fury, we've got Thanos all wrapped up with a bow on him. Wolverine is bringing him back to base."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_1,We'll put him on ice until we can figure out a way to uncorrupt him.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_2,"What, no ""thank you?"" Do we at least get paid now?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_3,Incoming!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_4,"Oh boy, oh boy! It's a minion mash. My favorite."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_INTRO_5,MAXIMUM EFFORT!
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_START_0,Strike down my minions if you must. It shall only make me stronger...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_MID_0,"Alright, this is getting a little stale. How about we just make these guys a little tougher from here on out?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_0,Phew! That was a real workout. We got Thanos AND took out the Techno Virus supply. Now we can fly off into the sunset...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_1,"Not so fast. The scientists who developed the tech are still out there. We have to stop them, or they'll just make more."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_08_END_2,"RIGHT ON. I wanted two more missions in this storyline, anyway. More Deadpool shards to give out!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_0,I've traced the corrupted Techno Virus to a lab in Budapest.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_1,Scientist Supreme and Ultron are teaming up to make a new batch of the corrupted virus for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_2,"Jiminy Jillickers, Cable! Whatever shall we do?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_3,"I might just sew your mouth shut. "
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_INTRO_4,That's just a ridiculous idea. Who would do that?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_0,Alrighty then. Time to take out a sexy scientist and a super genius.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_1,"Stay on mission, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_START_2,What? Ultron's got it GOIN' ON! Rawr.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_MID_0,Fools. The perfect form of this virus was created by our greatest mind. You are no match for them.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_0,So these chuckleheads aren't even the final bosses?
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_1,"We should probably go AUTO WIN some campaign missions and gear up, huh?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_09_END_2,We need to keep moving. Whoever's in charge is up ahead. Stay frosty.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_0,Whoever is in charge of this project is not someone we should take lightly.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_1,I wouldn't have it any other way.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_2,Little did our heroes know that a corrupted Vision was the mastermind of Ultimus's Techno-Organic Virus project.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_3,Soon they would be faced with the greatest challenge of their lives...
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_4,Shut up and focus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_5,What do you think I'm doing? This helps me focus my chi. Have some respect.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INTRO_6,Namaste.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_0,"Welcome, members of S.T.R.I.K.E."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_1,You will be the first to see the fruits of my labor. You should feel honored to become one with Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_2,"Not so fast, Robo Gandhi. If we take out your operators, you won't be able to beat us in this mission."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_3,"DP, that's not gonna work. We have to take out Vision first. It's our only shot."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_4,"That's why I love you, Cable. You always go right for the cojones."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_START_5,DEFEAT <color=#fff568>VISION</color> TO WIN.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_1_0,Vision's operators are prepping the virus. We need to take him out quickly.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_1_1,1 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_2_0,"Yeah, if we don't take Vision out, things are gonna get real weird, real fast."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_2_1,2 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_3_0,"Ok, the pucker factor is a little too high. Get Vision, now!"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_INFO_3_1,3 / 4 STAGES COMPLETE.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_FAIL_0,"At last, my virus is airborne. There's no stopping it now."
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_0,You fools... I'm trying to save you. With this virus we could have all become one.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_1," --"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_2,"And with that... He was gone. People for years to come would ask, where did Vision go? Why did he do what he did?"
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_3,The world may never know.
ID_DIALOG_DEADPOOL_EVENT_10_END_4,And... Scene.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_SHIELD_11_01_START_0,"Excuse me, I'm gonna have to see your lanyard if you want to proceed to T.A.H.I.T.I."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_SHIELD_11_01_START_1,Wait... are you a Life-Model Decoy? Halt!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_AIM_12_01_START_0,Behold my greatest creations!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_AIM_12_01_START_1,"And me, too!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_KREE_15_01_START_0,You have been judged! The sentence...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_KREE_15_01_START_1,"More Deadpool! ...Now how do you want to be executed? Guns, swords, or by being gummed to death by toothless weasels?"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_01_START_0,Fisk! What is this rabble doing here!? Be a good chap and order the servants to put bullets in our guests.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_01_START_1,"Right away, Mr. Deadpool, sir."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_02_START_0,"Good help is so hard to find these days. Come on, Fisk. Chop chop!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_16_MERC_02_START_1,"Yes, sir. Very good, sir."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_0,Ultron-Bots! Roll out!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_1,"Initiating attack pattern I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_01_START_2,I meant to change that.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_02_START_0,Let's form Ultron! I can form the head!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_18_ULTRONS_02_START_1,"Please, shut up."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_19_HYDRA_01_START_0,DP! We got company!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_19_HYDRA_01_START_1,"Don't worry, Bob. We're Hydra. If they cut off my head, two more take its place!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_28_AVENGERS_01_START_0,Avengers Assemble!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_28_AVENGERS_01_START_1,Hey! It worked this time!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_32_DEFENDERS_01_START_0,Need a blind lawyer? Need a drunk private investigator?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MB_32_DEFENDERS_01_START_1,Look no further than Deadpool's for Hire!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_30_FRIENDS_01_START_0,All my favorite characters in one mission.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_30_FRIENDS_01_START_1,This is gonna be AWESOME!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_31_BLEED_01_START_0,"Yes, it's true that I wear a red suit so that I don't have to worry about blood stains. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_FB_31_BLEED_01_START_1,"Kinda makes you wonder about Santa, doesn't it? "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_MYSTIC_01_START_0,The Eye of Chimichanga compels you!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_0,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend, Deadpool."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_1,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend, Deadpool.."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_2,"Hi, I'm Deadpool, and this is my friend..."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_BOB_01_START_3,Hi. I'm Bob.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_0,HULK SMASH!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_1,DEADPOOL STAB!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HULK_SPIDEY_01_START_2,Why did Ultimus stick me with these guys?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_01_START_0,Cap'n Deadpool! We have stowaways!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_01_START_1,Avast ye scurvy dogs! Defend our borders! Blast them down the black hole of Davy Jones' Locker!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_02_START_0,Why is the rum gone? Where be my booty? Yar!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_RAVAGERS_03_START_0,Me first-mate and I be taking charge now! We'll be making ye walk the plank!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_01_START_0,Sensei... Intruders have come to defile our inner sanctum!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_01_START_1,"Fear not, young padawan. Remember your training, and Deadpool will set you free."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_02_START_0,Wax on. Wax off. Bird kick! Mercy is for the weak.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_DEADPOOL_HAND_02_START_1,
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_01_START_0,I put the PAIN in propane...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_02_START_0,Time to die...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_03_START_0,"How do we want 'em, Raven? Extra crispy? Or flambeed?"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_03_START_1,Surprise me.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_04_START_0,Ultimus says I get to tear these S.T.R.I.K.E. suckers to shreds.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_04_START_1,"You've earned it, Victor. Enjoy the hunt."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_05_START_0,I'm impressed you made it this far.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_05_START_1,"However, this is the end of the line."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_06_START_0,We are the one true Brotherhood of Mutants.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_MB_06_START_1,"If you were hoping for mercy, you will find none here..."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_FB_01_START_0,"Surrender now, while you still have the chance."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_JU_FB_01_MID_0,"Juggernaut, comin' through!"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_01_START_0,You think you can beat me? Let's dance.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_02_START_0,Give up while you still have the chance. You're embarrassing yourselves.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_03_START_0,I can't wait to slay more pathetic heroes! YES YES!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_03_START_1,"Hold your horses there, Carnage Asada."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_03_START_2,We're gonna be doin' the slaying THIS time around.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_04_START_0,I WILL DESTROY YOU!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_04_START_1,"Norman, I think you might be throwing back too many Gamma Radiation-infused Kombuchas."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_04_START_2,"Time for those twelve steps again, buddy."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_05_START_0,You are weak and pathetic. All that power and you use it for THIS!?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_05_START_1,"They haven't seen the light, like we have, Norman."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_05_START_2,Time to enlighten these chumps... By bathing them in BLOOD!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_06_START_0,You aren't getting past me again!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_MB_06_START_1,You aren't going ANYWHERE again. EVER.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_FB_01_START_0,"After all of this, you still wanna fight?"
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_FB_01_MID_0,You really think you can stop us?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_FB_01_MID_1,OR CONTROL... US?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_FB_01_MID_2,You don't stand a chance. Your fragile lives end here and now.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_USP_FB_01_END_0,You're only delaying the inevitable... Your ultimate destruction is near...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_0,"Greetings, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_1,"It is I... Victor Von Doom,\nmonarch of Latveria... a nation that YOU are failing to protect."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_2,For TOO long Doom has watched as S.T.R.I.K.E. has incompetently mismanaged the fight against Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_3,"Magneto and his Brotherhood have feebly attempted to exact revenge upon Ultimus, and Nick Fury flails about like a duck unable to float."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_4,"It is clear to Doom that YOU are a capable enough commander to mount an effective defense of our world, unlike that fool, Fury. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_5,"Ultimus and the First Legion have\nlaid waste to my cherished homeland, Latveria. We will return the favor in kind."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_6,"Doom has mapped the pathways that will lead us to the heart of Ultimus's interdimensional empire. "
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_7,There you will battle his most ardent supporters and obliterate gateways that allow his fleet to move between his conquered dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_START_8,NO ONE invades Doom's domain without consequence.\nDOOM will NOT ALLOW IT.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_END_0,"Now you will raid the heart of Ultimus's empire, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_END_1,Together we will crush Ultimus and teach that insolent whelp the truth he denies...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_01_END_2,DOOM is the only rightful ruler of the multiverse!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_02_START_0,Ultimus has squandered his opportunity to seize Latveria. Use this fight to prove your mettle.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_02_START_1,Vanquish these fools to make your way to MY dimensional portal.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_02_END_0,DOOM is NOT impressed. A blind baboon could have defeated those minions.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_02_END_1,Perhaps I was wrong to choose you in this endeavor. How you perform behind enemy lines will show me your TRUE worth.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_01_START_0,"This dimension serves as a forward rallying point for the First Legion, the most loyal pawns of Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_01_START_1,Destroy their gateway and expose Ultimus for the naive fool he is.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_01_END_0,"A mediocre fight gets mediocre results.\nI demand more. If we are to disrupt Ultimus, you must do better."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_02_START_0,You've proven adequate to this point.\nLet's see how you fair with a more challenging fight.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_02_START_1,Destroy the gateway construction facility on this world to prevent Ultimus from rebuilding what we have destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_02_END_0,A modest success. Doom demands more. Advance to the next dimension!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FAIL_0,"Your failure, though predictable, is barely a setback for Doom."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FAIL_1,"Perhaps Doom was wrong to entrust YOU with such a task, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_03_START_0,It seems that Ultimus is gathering the Helicarriers of many dimensions in this place. The gate must fall.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_03_START_1,DOOM suspects this fight will push you to your limits. Show your true resolve.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_03_END_0,Impressive enough. For now. Though there is much yet to be done.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_START_0,"This realm closely mirrors that of our dimension, including its weak-minded slaves."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_START_1,Is Ultimus so arrogant that he would leave one of his precious Conversion Engines so poorly defended?
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_START_2,It appears that conversion weakens the resolve of the victim over time... but their loyalty remains undiminished.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_START_3,Show these whelps the wrath of DOOM!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_MID_0,DOOM!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_MID_1,DOOM!!!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_MID_2,DOOOOM!!!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_MID_3,You dare to mock DOOM? Destroy them!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_04_END_0,That was a GROSS mockery of Doom. NEVER speak of this again.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_05_START_0,"In this dimension, Earth is in the midst of an Ice Age. The First Legion holds their rituals of supplication here."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_05_START_1,"Destroy the First Legion acolytes,\nbut beware. They are quite deadly in their fervor."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_05_END_0,I must admit that you have progressed further than expected. Perhaps you will rise to a greater challenge...
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_06_START_0,"In this reality, Ultimus recently secured a ruined Earth from savage Symbiotes."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_06_START_1,Ultimus experiments on them in a vain effort to improve his Conversion Engines. End his experiment.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_06_END_0,Your competence continues to prove sufficient... more than I can say for my minions.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_MB_06_END_1,These final battles will likely be your end. Perhaps you and your allies can survive. Unlikely.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_START_0,We near the end. You have shown that you can rise to the challenge I've presented to you.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_START_1,Doom is going to enjoy this.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_END_0,"Rich and powerful Kree shower Ultimus with gifts to gain his favor. He displays these in an ancient, sacred temple in Dimension 194-X3."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_END_1,"Destroy this treasure trove, just as he destroyed the national artifacts of Latveria. Let his loyalists watch in horror as their treasures burn."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_END_2,You are clearly strong enough to fight on the frontlines of the mutant conflict. Annihilate his corrupted forces and obliterate the temple.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_PRE-FB_01_END_3,Doom WILL have his FULL revenge.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FB_01_START_0,"No matter how many corrupted forces Ultimus throws at you, he underestimates you."
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FB_01_START_1,Show him the errors of his ways.\nDOOM knows you are stronger!
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FB_01_END_0,A most satisfying victory.\nUltimus can no longer deny S.T.R.I.K.E.'s valor and conviction.
ID_DIALOG_EVR_BDY_FB_01_END_1,"Doom enjoys seeing Ultimus squirm.\nYou have done well, Commander."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_0,"Fury, if we are going to win this war, we need to attack Ultimus on all fronts."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_1,"Allow me to send mercenaries to fallen dimensions and ""relieve"" Ultimus of his gold holdings."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_2,Interesting... What makes gold so important to Ultimus?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_3,The Kree people love gold. Especially gold from conquered worlds.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_4,"If Ultimus loses gold acquired from his conquests, it will send ripples through the multiverse. Plus, it will fill our coffers in our time of need."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_5,"So you're telling me we can get a bunch of gold, piss off Ultimus, and make the Kree nobility turn their noses up at him?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_6,"Rally your soldiers of fortune. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_INTRO_7,"Bullseye, time to put on your finest suit. Gold is on the menu for today."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_START_0,This first stockpile is gonna be easy pickings.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_START_1,"Plus, it's guarded by corrupted heroes.\nMy favorite."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_0,"Alright, let's load up the gold and blow this popsicle stand."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_1,"Wait, you want to blow the place up too?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_01_END_2,"Not what I meant, but sure, why not?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_INTRO_0,Your next target is more heavily fortified. Be prepared.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_INTRO_1,GOOD. I did the last one with my eyes closed.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_START_0,We've been expecting you.\nUltimus demands your blood.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_START_1,Yeah... but you brought a fist to a knife fight.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_END_0,"That was a mess, but we secured the gold."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_02_END_1,"Yeah, maybe it's time we started looking for extra help..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_0,"Fisk, we need to bolster our numbers if we want to keep this up."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_1,Run-of-the-mill mercs aren't going to cut it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_2,"Be careful what you wish for, Lester."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_3,Oh my god... Your name is LESTER? SO MANY WAYS I CAN GO WITH THIS!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_4," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_INTRO_5,"You know what, Fisk? We're good. Don't need the help..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_0,Ultimus has had enough with your band of hirelings.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_1,I will personally see to it your crime spree ends here.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_START_2,"Wouldn't be much of a ""spree"" if you stopped it now, would it? "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_0,"Hey, big guy, we both have Wilson in our name. We already have two thirds of a Wilson Phillips cover band."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_1,"We should find a Phillips and go on tour. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_2,"See what I mean, Fisk? I can't take it any more."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_03_END_3,"Quit the chatter, Deadpool. Stealing money is serious business."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_0,I've located a massive stockpile of gold.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_1,The gold cache is on an Earth ravaged by meteorites... and corrupted Avengers.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_2,Dodging falling junk while fighting giant green rage monsters?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_INTRO_3,WHERE DO I SIGN UP?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_0,Stop. These riches belong to Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_1,"Each time you say the word ""stop"" and don't immediately follow it up with ""Hammer Time""..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_START_2,I'm going to shoot you for a missed opportunity.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_04_END_0,Goal for Deadpool! The crowd goes wild!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_0,So you're like some sort of cosmic bounty hunter?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_1," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_2,"Strong silent type. I get that. Maybe I should try to be silent too? No, really, look, here I go."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_3," ..."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_INTRO_4,Nope. Terrible. Hate it. Never again.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_0,So lovely to have guests! A pity we have to kill you immediately.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_1,The hunt begins.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_START_2,It speaks!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_0,This horde of gold is... It's too much!
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_1,Not a problem. That's what my supply of Pym Particle Disks is for.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_05_END_2,I'm sure Ant-Man can appreciate the irony that I stole them from him.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_0,"Hey Fisk, where do you keep getting all this intel from?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_1,"Are you catfishing Ultimus? I mean, the dude is evil incarnate but even that seems kind of low. I expect more from you!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_2,It's amazing the things you learn when torturing a corrupted Deadpool over and over until he spills the beans on Ultimus's gold reserves.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_3,Huh... that's... dark...
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_INTRO_4,A vault of great importance to Ultimus is located on the surface of this dimension's Mars. Clean it out.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_START_0,We are the Guardians of the Vault.\nPrepare to meet your end.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_START_1,"Yeah, you need to work on that name."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_0,What the heck is Ultimus even storing in this thing?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_1,Gold. More gold. Some works of art created in his honor.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_2,Yeah... I see why he hides that painting in here. His nose looks HUGE.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_06_END_3,I bet that artist no longer has a home planet.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_0,Time for the big one.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_1,This dimension is ruled by a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. regime.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_2,Hijack their primary Helicarrier and loot the contents within.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_INTRO_3,Sounds like my kind of party.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_0,"So you're trying to rob a Helicarrier, huh? Cute."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_1,"This is about the gold, not my dashing good looks."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_2,"Lester, please. I'm better looking than you, and I look like a shaved hedgehog."
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_3,Why must he always be talking...
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_START_4,You LITERALLY have a target on your face. What do you expect?
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_0,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_1,Good. Now we have enough gold to fund S.T.R.I.K.E. operations for years to come.
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_2,"And this will spawn rebellions against Ultimus among the Kree. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_MERC_07_END_3,"Kingpin, keep the details of this matter between us. These resources need to remain secret. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, for centuries the Hand have searched for an ancient sword of great importance to my people: the Yokai No Odachi."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_1,"With help from S.T.R.I.K.E., we discovered members of Ultimus's army are in possession of a piece of the sword."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_2,"Once we have the Odachi, the Hand of this dimension will be connected to our people across all the realms."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_3,Do what you must to recover the relic. I'd rather see you with the sword than Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_INTRO_4,"Elektra, gather our brothers and sisters to handle this important endeavor."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_START_0,Beware of these corrupted pawns of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_START_1,They have enhanced reflexes and will strike with lethal precision.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_0,This corrupted Hand Sentry was protecting a piece of the Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_1,Secure it in our stronghold while we search for the remaining six pieces of the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_01_END_2,It shall be done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_0,We've tracked down the second piece of the Yokai No Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_1,"However, it appears a corrupted Kingpin and Korath have gotten to it first."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_INTRO_2,Eliminate them and find out why corrupted forces are trying to recover the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_START_0,It appears the shattered remnants of the Hand also seek the Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_START_1,Their attempts will end in failure. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_END_0,We have recovered the second piece of the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_02_END_1,But why does Ultimus want the sword? This is an ill omen.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_0,It is concerning that Ultimus is sending corrupted forces after the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_1,"If they secure the pieces, they will corrupt Hand warriors across all dimensions with a single ritual."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_INTRO_2,"We will stop them, I swear it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_START_0,Mordo's powers have enhanced the dark energy emanating from these corrupted.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_START_1,It will be difficult for us to channel our healing arts. Prepare yourselves.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_0,Mordo had the third piece of the sword. We are making progress.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_1,Do not grow overconfident. There are still four pieces out there. Make haste.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_03_END_2,Perhaps it is time to utilize other S.T.R.I.K.E. assets to find the remaining pieces of the relic.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_0,"Matthew, what do you have for me?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_1,The fourth piece of the relic is in the hands of corrupted Guardians.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_INTRO_2,Lovely. I was wondering when Ultimus would give us a real challenge.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_0,Hand over the piece of the relic now and we will spare you.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_1,HAND over the piece? Really? Too easy.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_2,Ultimus gave me some cutting edge Kree ammo from the armory.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_START_3,Say hello to my little friend!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_04_END_0,We now have the fourth piece of the Yokai No Odachi. Three more to go...
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_0,"The fifth piece of the sword is likely in Warsaw, which was recently attacked by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_1,We must find it and keep it from the corrupted forces in the area.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_INTRO_2,It shall be done.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_START_0,"Ms. Natchios, you are of course too late to recover your precious artifact."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_START_1,"But do not fret, my lady. You will soon have the esteemed honor of dying by my hands."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_END_0,Five pieces recovered. We are so close.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_05_END_1,Not as close as you think. We need to talk.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_0,"I've discovered that corrupted Hand forces are in possession of the final two fragments of the sword in Hakone, Japan."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_1,They no longer need the pieces you found.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_2,They are close to deconstructing versions of the Odachi from other dimensions to restore the sword.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_INTRO_3,Then we must hurry. Otherwise Ultimus will destroy our way of life. IKUZO!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_START_0,Corrupted Elektra and her assassins are blocking the path.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_START_1,Then show them the error of their ways.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_0,We have recovered the sixth piece of the Yokai No Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_1,None of that will matter if they can still restore the blade with fragments from other dimensions.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_06_END_2,SUSUME!
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_0,We will not allow these false Hand soldiers to restore the Odachi for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_1,We must eliminate them once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_INTRO_2,"By our honor, we will not fail.\nFOR THE HAND!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_START_0,You ninjas really think you can stop this? Ultimus will have his prize.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_START_1,Not if I have anything to say about it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_0,We have all seven pieces of the true Odachi.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_1,The Hand have won this battle once and for all.
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_2,"Fury, we can now reach out to our other brothers and sisters en masse."
ID_DIALOG_FL_HAND_07_END_3,A multidimensional horde of ninjas fighting by our side? Works for me.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_0,"Scott, we've just received a distress call from resistance forces in the micro dimension."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_1,Ultimus has been abducting scientists en masse to work on some kind of mysterious project.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_2,"That's a bummer, but that world is controlled by corrupted forces. There's not a lot we can do about it."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_3,We're the ONLY ones that can do something about it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_4,"Scott, they need our help!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_5,"Alright Hope. If you think we can make a difference, count me in. Let's put a squad together."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_6,"No can do, Lang. Only you and Hope can return to that dimension."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_7,Our experimental Pym tech only worked when the planet was preserved in the orb's stasis field.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_8,"Wait, so we're gonna have to do this just the two of us?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_9,"Scott, we can do this. We HAVE to do this. After all..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_10,We're Wasp and the Ant-Man.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_INTRO_11,"Ok, you got me. That was really cool. Let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_0,"Scott, how are your gauges holding up?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_1,Looking good. This should be\na piece of cake.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_2,"At this size, compared to the bad guys we should be way over-powered."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_3,Here's hoping. Resistance intel suggests we take out this armory to disrupt their forced recruitment operations.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_START_4,Let's beat up some tiny Hydra dudes.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_0,"Ok, they still pack a punch,\neven at this size."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_1,Nothing we can't handle.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_2,Wanna go steal a Helicarrier?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_01_END_3,Heli-yes!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_0,If we can take control of this Helicarrier the resistance will gather momentum.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_1,"If you can defeat us, perhaps."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_START_2,Oh boy.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_0,"Man, I never thought I'd see the day I'd go back to my old heist days."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_1,It's for a good cause.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_2,You don't need to tell me that.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_02_END_3,"Cassie will understand, Scott.\nLet's keep going."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_0,Resistance forces have confirmed the abducted scientists all specialized in working with technology similar to Pym Particles.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_1,Good thing we're here!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_INTRO_2,The latest group of scientists was abducted in Little Tokyo. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_0,"Hey dirtbags, stop stealing scientists of Little Tokyo to do Ultimus's dirty work.\nOr else."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_1,"Or else, what?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_2,Or else... We'll stop you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_START_3,"Scott. Less words, more Ant-Man-ing."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_END_0,I get the feeling Ultimus has been alerted to our presence.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_03_END_1,We need to pick up the pace and find out what Ultimus is working on.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_0,"Wolvie, LOOK LOOK! Fresh meat for us to return back to Ultimus in a body bag!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_1,If they're lucky.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_START_2,Don't underestimate us. We've dealt with worse than you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_0,THAT was intense. Those guys never\nstood a chance.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_1,"Remind me to never piss you off, Hope."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_04_END_2,I'd go easy on you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_0,Where to next?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_1,There are rumors that this dimension's Kingpin is working on a plan to poison people with an airborne corruption bio-weapon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_2,Who's giving you this intel?\nYour resistance contact?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_3,A little bird told me.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_INTRO_4,Nice.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_0,"Fisk, we're shutting down this operation. It's over."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_1,How very nice of you to show up.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_2,Nothing brings me greater joy than eliminating pests.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_START_3,"You should find some better hobbies, man."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_0,Crisis averted!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_1,We still have the big fish to fry.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_05_END_2,Time to find out who's really pulling the strings on this planet for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_0,"Scott, remember how you enjoyed breaking into the Avengers headquarters?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_1,"You mean when I beat Falcon?\nYes, I remember."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_2,That was awesome.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_3,"Well, this time we need to break into the Pentagon."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_4,NO WAY.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_5,The mysterious leader of Ultimus's forces on micro Earth has a secret facility under the Pentagon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_6,We need to sneak our way in to confront them.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_7,Time to get EVEN smaller.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_INTRO_8,This is so cool...
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_0,"Okay, we're in. Security seemed a bit lax..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_1,Agreed. Something doesn't feel right.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_2,"Welcome, Ant-Man and The Wasp.\nYour quest to save this world ends here."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_START_3,That's... a lot of Nick Fury Life-Model Decoys... I think.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_0,You're too late. The Queen's plan cannot be stopped.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_1,Our captured scientists have already completed Ultimus's next great work.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_2,That doesn't sound good.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_3,"Come on, Scott. We're so close to ending this. The lab is up ahead."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_06_END_4,Time to find out who this Queen is.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_0,You.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_1,I don't know whether to be flattered or miffed that this planet's evil mastermind is my doppelganger.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_2,"I'd lean towards miffed. But it's a surprise, I'll give you that."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_3,"My Queen, Pym Particle enhanced Ultron production lines are operational."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_4,Your scientists have ensured the production lines will continue as long as you retain command.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_START_5,Thanks for telling us how to defeat you! Really appreciate it!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_0,We did it!  Tiny world is saved.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_1,Good thing Ultimus won't be able to use Pym Particle enhanced Ultron bots any time soon.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_2,That would have been super bad.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_3,Ready to return home?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_4,Let's do it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_07_END_5,"So long, Tiny World. It's been real."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_INTRO_0,"Scott, where are we?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_INTRO_1,It looks like Scientist Supreme's experiment damaged our suits.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_INTRO_2,"Pft, that's SCIENCE for you."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_INTRO_3,"This is inconvenient, but I have some intel that might help us."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_START_0,You're in over your heads!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_START_1,Can I have ONE heist that goes as planned?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_END_0,Yellowjacket in any universe is a pain in the neck.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_END_1,"The good news is that our suits are repaired, and we'll be able to get out of here."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_END_2,That sounds like there's also bad news.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_08_END_3,There is: \n We're being followed.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_INTRO_0,I think we lost them.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_INTRO_1,I don't think they'll give up that easily.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_INTRO_2,We've been running for a while...
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_INTRO_3,"And still, you have not outrun me."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_START_0,"Hope, you better get out of here!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_START_1,"I'm NOT leaving you, Scott!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_MID_0,"Give me back my parents, you giant blueberry!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_END_0,"Cassie, what are you doing here?!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_END_1,Quake called me when you two took longer than expected.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_END_2,And you came alone?!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_END_3,"As much as I LOVE getting scolded, we should leave before he wakes up."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_09_END_4,Good point. I'll let it slide this time!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_0,Ready to get that M'Kraan Crystal off of you?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_1,"YES PLEASE. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_2,"Polymorphing it off doesn't work, and NOW it's starting to itch. Ugh."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_3,Intel indicates Scientist Supreme might be able to help.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_4,She's been gathering parts to build a device that specializes in nullifying magical objects.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_INTRO_5,Then that's where we'll search first.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_0,Word on the street says you're looking to make a device that nullifies magical objects.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_1,True... But MY sources say you have a powerful crystal in your possession.\nHand it over.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_START_2,Not gonna happen.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_0,"Okay, fine, you win.\nCan't blame me for trying..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_1,"What the heck, lady! We came here for your help, and you tried to steal the crystal from us?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_2,"Look, Ultimus has the device you want."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_3,"My version is too early in prototyping to be of any use. It's embarrassing, really."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_01_END_4,"Why not just steal HIS version? I tried, believe me. Maybe you can succeed where I failed."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_0,So Ultimus has a device that can unstick this thing from me? Let's go get it then!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_1,"Quake, can you help us track down where Ultimus is keeping such a device?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_2,"Ladies, no time for that, I need you back here, pronto. The Helicarrier is under attack."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_INTRO_3,Ugh. Again?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_0,"Surrender now, or we'll raid this ship in the name of Ultimus!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_1,Whoa. We're being attacked by space pirates?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_START_2,It happens more often than you might think.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_END_0,"Ms. Marvel, are you feeling alright?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_02_END_1,I... don't know. This crystal is starting to make me feel... weird.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_0,What's happening to Ms. Marvel?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_1,"With the crystal bound to her, it's running into unforeseen complications."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_2,The healing factor in her Inhuman DNA is trying to feed off the energy in the M'Kraan Crystal. This is causing the crystal's temperature to rise.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_3,Wait. Am I gonna explode? I don't wanna explode!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_4,"Stay calm. We can figure this out. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_5,The good news is we've tracked down a possible location for Ultimus's device.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_INTRO_6,Head to the docks. The device is in a shipment intended for Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_START_0,There's the shipment. Let's take it off their hands.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_0,"Look, there's the device. We found it!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_1,"True, but we don't have the expertise to operate it and nullify the crystal."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_03_END_2,We need to bring this back to Scientist Supreme.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_0,"Okay, so all we gotta do is bring this device back to Scientist Supreme so she can fix me before I explode."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_1,No pressure...
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_2,"Halt, heathens. Surrender that crystal and the Unbinder to us now, and we will spare you."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_INTRO_3,The Unbinder? Seriously? Who names these things?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_START_0,You guys should really quit while you're behind.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_START_1,You're going to walk away empty-handed.\nIf you're lucky.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_0,"Scientist Supreme, can you help us figure out how to activate this device?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_1,We need to get this crystal away from Ms. Marvel immediately.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_04_END_2,Of course! Let's take a closer look at it in my lab.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_0,Hmmm... It looks like this Unbinder is missing two key components. A Conjure Stone and a Cosmic Cube.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_1,A Conjure Stone... I know where to find one!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_2,Really? How?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_3,"Since becoming the Nexus Being, I've begun to hear voices calling me to mystic objects of power."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_4,"There is a Conjure Stone close to here, I can feel it. It's being held in a nuclear submarine base controlled by Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_INTRO_5,Cool! Let's go get it before this crystal makes me explode.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_0,"If you think you'll get this Conjure Stone without a fight, you are a fool."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_1,"Actually, I was planning to smack you with my giant hand and then yoink it from you."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_START_2,Sounds like we're on the same page.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_0,We've got the stone.\nOnly the Cosmic Cube remains.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_1,"That's good cuz... phew... Is it getting hot in here, or is it just me?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_05_END_2,This M'Kraan Crystal is starting to get CRAZY hot now.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_0,I am TOTES looking forward to taking a cold shower after all this is done with.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_1,I sense the presence of a Cosmic Cube nearby.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_2,Awesome! Where?
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_3,I can hear it in that building. Looks like it's owned by something called Hope Yards--
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_4,Ohhhhh... HYDRA. I get it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_INTRO_5,Looks like we have a SNAKE problem in Jersey City. Again.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_0,"Hand over the Cosmic Cube, and I promise not to have Captain America kick your butt in my next fanfic."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_1,You have taken a great risk to come here with the M'Kraan Crystal in your possession.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_START_2,It's time to teach you both a lesson in humility.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_0,Defeating me accomplishes NOTHING.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_1,"How so? We've got the Cosmic Cube, and you're down for the count."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_2,"The Cube is of little importance, child."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_06_END_3,The underground invasion of your pathetic city has already begun. You cannot stop it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_0,We have what we need to make the Unbinder work. Time to get that crystal off of you before it's too late.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_1,"I can't... not yet! This is MY city, and I can't stand by and watch Ultimus destroy it while I'm off saving my own skin."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_2,But the M'Kraan Crystal might kill you! I can't let that happen to you.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_3,Help me stop this invasion first. Please.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_4," --"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_5,Very well. We can try. But we must get you back to Scientist Supreme immediately afterwards.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_INTRO_6,YES! Let's do this!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_START_0,They've already got one of those portal thingies open down here! This is bad.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_START_1,"If we can fight them off, I can seal the portal from this side."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_0,"Activate the Unbinder, hurry!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_1,"Alright, hold still, my dear.\nThis... is going to sting. A lot."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_2,AGH!
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_3,It's done.
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_4,"Good news! The M'Kraan Crystal is cooling rapidly. It's all yours, Scarlet Witch."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_5,"Ms. Marvel, are you okay?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_6,"Yeah, I'm good. Thanks again for all the help."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_7,"You can call me Kamala, by the way."
ID_DIALOG_TU_SW_MM_07_END_8,"I'm Wanda. Pleasure to meet you, Kamala."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_0,"With the invasion of Ultimus, New York City and its surrounding areas are becoming overwhelmed."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_1,S.T.R.I.K.E. agents have been deployed and are doing their best...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_2,But we need to organize all our local heroes to keep the situation from spiraling out of control.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_3,"Night Nurse, that's where you come in."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_4,You have a pulse on what all of the area's local heroes are up to.\nTime to form up.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_INTRO_5,Sounds like a plan. Spider-Man needs help stopping a chemical weapons hand-off over in Queens.\nThat's where we'll start.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_START_0,Spider-Man and a few S.T.R.I.K.E. rejects... Do you really think you can stop us?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_START_1,Don't underestimate us.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_0,"Thanks for the help! "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_1,Of course. Couldn't risk Ultimus's forces getting ahold of those chemical weapons from Dark Watch.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_01_END_2,Luke's got a situation going down in Harlem that we should help with. Let's move.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_0,"Luke, brief us on the situation."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_1,Word on the street is there's a bad batch of Vibranium in a warehouse here in Harlem.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_2,What makes it so bad?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_3,The Vibranium is unstable and could be made into a large supply of lethal explosives.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_4,That's bad.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_INTRO_5,We need to get to that shipment before corrupted forces can get their hands on it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_START_0,Haven't you brainwashed fools gotten the memo yet? Harlem is my town. Stay out.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_0,That's one less thing to worry about now. What's next?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_1,Punisher is planning to take out a Hydra squad intent on securing a cache of Judas rounds.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_2,"That would be great, but he's probably going to overdo it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_02_END_3,Let's make sure he doesn't get out of control.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_0,Not interested in teaming up with you folks. I can handle this myself.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_1,"Punisher, we need to keep the collateral damage to a minimum. This city has suffered enough in this invasion."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_2,"Step aside, Cage. The special ammo they're transporting could hurt even you."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_3,"How about this? We help you here... you get to keep doing things ""your way"" in future fights against corrupted forces. How's that sound?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_4,...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_5,Works for me. Just don't start whining if things get too rough for your tastes.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_INTRO_6,"Maybe I should make you a web gun or something. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_START_0,Secure the ammunition quickly before the Punisher gets here!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_START_1,Too late.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_END_0,"Cache secured, Hydra scum crossed out. Win-win."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_03_END_1,Can't celebrate just yet. Daredevil needs our help in Hell's Kitchen.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_0,Corrupted Hand forces have somehow gotten their hands on some Chitauri weapons.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_1,From the first invasion of New York by Loki? I thought S.H.I.E.L.D. had secured all of those.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_2,Not all of them. Folks pop up with them from time to time.\nRemember Vulture?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_INTRO_3,"If we don't get those weapons, it's going to make securing New York impossible."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_0,"So, is it easier or harder to fight Ultimus's army for you?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_1,"Easier. Something about their corruption gives them a unique vibrational signature. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_START_2,"Bad vibes, huh? My Spidey-Sense is dialed in, too."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_04_END_0,That's the last of them. Time to regroup on the Helicarrier to figure out our next move.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_0,"Jessica, any luck tracking that corrupted Cosmic squad that's been roughing up Midtown?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_1,Zilch.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_2,I think they're using some kind of fancy alien tech to stay hidden.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_3,"They could have followed us back to the Helicarrier, and we wouldn't even know it."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_4,"Speaking of which... Spider-Sense tingling... Bad vibes, guys!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_INTRO_5,Called it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_START_0,I am GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_START_1,Nope.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_0,I am so sick of fighting stupid aliens.\nThis is NOT what I signed up for.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_1,What DID you sign up for?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_05_END_2,Top-shelf booze. Fury promised me access to his personal supply.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_0,"Danny, how can we help you in the Upper West Side?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_1,Things are looking pretty bad right now.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_2,Ultimus has a team of corrupted mystics working on opening a dimensional gateway deep in the heart of the city.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_3,"Look, I'm not a wizard, magician, or whatever. What can I do to help?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_4,"Well, I discovered their super-secret weakness: really hard punches. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_INTRO_5,"Okay, yeah, I can do that."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_0,You cannot stop the opening of this gateway. It is the will of Ultimus.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_1,I am the Immortal Iron Fist. You will fail. Count on it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_START_2,"Yeah, what he said!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_0,They have no chance of opening that portal now.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_1,"So, we win? Time for some R & R?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_2,We're not done yet. Ms. Marvel needs our help.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_06_END_3,The situation in Jersey City just went from bad to worse. We have to hurry!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_0,"Guys, I've been doing my best to keep them at bay, but they just keep coming."
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_1,Who?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_2,Mutants... Inhumans...\nCorrupted ones. Lots of 'em.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_3,They've started to overrun Jersey City. I don't think I can do this on my own!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_4,"You don't have to, Ms. Marvel.\nWe're a team.\nWe're the City Heroes!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_INTRO_5,"Nice speech, kid. Top shelf. "
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_START_0,This city belongs to Ultimus.\nSurrender now or be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_START_1,Not gonna happen. I'm Ms. Marvel and this is MY city.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_0,No! Ultimus even has corrupted versions of me? This is bad.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_1,Don't sweat it. He's got evil versions of all of us...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_MID_2,That's somehow better?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_0,And stay out!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_1,You know what? I think this team has a bright future ahead of it.
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_2,If we manage to save the multiverse and all that...
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_3,"Oh, we should give ourselves a name!"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_4,"What, City Heroes of S.T.R.I.K.E. isn't good enough?"
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_5,Too wordy. East Side Avengers? Downtown Funk?\nKnights of New York?
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_6,Don't forget Jersey City!
ID_DIALOG_FL_CITY_HERO_07_END_7,"Oh, right. Hmmm... This is tougher than I thought."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_01_START_0,Doom's map of dimensional pathways has led us deep into Ultimus's territory.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_01_START_1,"It's going to be more dangerous here on out. Watch your six, Tony."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_01_END_0,Keep an eye out for corrupted S.T.R.I.K.E. teams. I've got a hunch Ultimus has a plan up his sleeve.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_01_END_1,Good thing I upgraded my friend-or-foe targeting system.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_01_END_2,"Call me old-fashioned, but I just look for the glowing eyes."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_02_START_0,The dimensional pathways provided by Doctor Doom will help us reach vulnerable targets.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_02_START_1,Ultimus is already using his corrupted S.T.R.I.K.E. forces to protect this territory.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_02_END_0,Those guys can pack a real punch.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_02_END_1,Indeed. I recalibrated my defense matrixes three times during that fight.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_02_END_2,Ultimus is likely using corrupted S.T.R.I.K.E. Helicarriers to shift his troops around in response to Doom.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_03_START_0,Why do I get the feeling that Ultimus has been toying with us?
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_03_START_1,"I think you're right. These guys are giving us a real workout, for once."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_03_END_0,We need to use Doom's map to work our way deep into Ultimus's territory.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_03_END_1,Maybe. Though it seems fishy that Ultimus is shifting corrupted S.T.R.I.K.E. teams around so aggressively.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_04_START_0,"Hulk LIKE fighting... Hulk want SMASH! "
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_04_START_1,"Yes, my colossal green friend! With Doom's map in hand, we will smash ALL of Ultimus's pretty little things."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_04_END_0,Those foes were worthy and not to be trifled with. That much is certain.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_04_END_1,I would venture to guess that Ultimus has laid great challenges ahead.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_04_END_2,He has captured many Helicarriers not unlike our own.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_05_START_0,"Mr. Lang, we must proceed with caution from here."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_05_START_1,"Roger that, King Panther. Doom's cheatsheet is gonna take us straight to the heart of Ultimus's empire."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_05_END_0,Something does not seem right... Ultimus has prepared for our attack.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_05_END_1,"If I'm reading this chart right, he already beat S.T.R.I.K.E. on hundreds of Earths. That means he has all their stuff, right?"
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_06_START_0,"With Doom's map, we'll be able to get straight to the heart of Ultimus's operation."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_06_START_1,We can't afford to hold back. We have to push forward.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_06_END_0,We need to move fast. Ultimus is already starting to reallocate his corrupted S.T.R.I.K.E. forces in response to Doom.
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_06_END_1,This is a play taken straight from the S.T.R.I.K.E. playbook...
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_MB_01_END_0,"Commander of S.T.R.I.K.E., you have proven yourself a worthy adversary."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_MB_01_END_1,"But acting as a pawn for Doom? That's beneath you, Commander. You deserve the honor of serving ME."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_MB_01_END_2,"Many iterations of S.T.R.I.K.E. have attempted to liberate my conquered Earths. All have failed, and now they serve me... just as you will."
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_MB_01_END_3,"Soon, my enlightened S.T.R.I.K.E. resources will prove to be your end. Have you prepared for the coming storm?"
ID_DIALOG_RAID_ULTVII_MB_01_END_4,This WAR has only just begun...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_0,"Groot, I've got a crazy idea that I think JUST might work, but it's gonna take the both of us."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_1,There's this VIP we gotta impress. We just get their attention by putting together a BIG haul of goods to entice 'em. Real nice stuff.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_2,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_3,"Well... cuz I need something that only THEY have access to. If we get in good with 'em, it'll help S.T.R.I.K.E. out, too! Two Skrulls with one stone."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_4,"We're gonna need some REALLY special items... Things like Magneto's helmet, Cap's shield--"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_5,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_6,"Mjolnir? How would you do that, buddy? You planning on being ordained with the power of Thor anytime soon?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_7,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_8,"Of course you're worthy, pal. Look, if we can raid some corrupted bases and take their toys away, that'll be good enough."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_9,"Some corrupted Hand ninjas have resurfaced at a dojo in Harlem. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_INTRO_10,"If we help out Luke and Jessica with this, they'll let us keep Nobu's fancy sword. Let's do this."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_START_0,Luke and Jessica are gonna meet us here... As long as we don't--
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_START_1,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_START_2,"Sure, fine, go in guns blazing, why not...\nEAT THIS, NINJAS!!!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_MID_0,What happened to waiting for us to get here?!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_MID_1,Why does everyone always assume I'm the one who rushes in? Groot did it!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_END_0,"I haven't had that much fun punching ninjas since... wait, didn't we clear this dojo last week? These guys don't quit!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_END_2,"No thanks to YOU, ya big dummy!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_01_END_3,"Well, actually, you were a literal force of nature back there, so... Nice work."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_1,"I know, right?\nWe are now OFFICIALLY space ninjas!\nThis is too cool."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_2,One ninja's ancestral relic is another schmo's collector's item. Heh.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_4,Let's hit that corrupted Brotherhood stronghold that's been causing problems for T'Challa and Ororo.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_INTRO_5,Magneto's helmet would be a good prize. And that fluffy coat of Sabretooth's. That thing's gotta be SUPER soft.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_START_0,"Rocket, Groot... Welcome. This base has been responsible for several devastasting attacks against Wakandan forces."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_START_1,Our pleasure! Any chance to help the cause and get some souvenirs in the process.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_START_2,Wakanda will be in your debt.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_DP_0,"Now, now, S.T.R.I.K.E., you didn't ask for permission to come blow up our second favorite submarine base."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_DP_1,Ugh. Deadpools. Of course they've got Deadpools.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_DP_2,The Sabretooth that rips you to shreds gets to wear you as a scarf.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_DP_3,I'm gonna use a laser pointer to get them to chase you. They just can't resist the red dot!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_END_1,"Exactly! That guy always just talks and talks and TALKS! I swear, his mutant ability must be to annoy people to death."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_02_END_2,Let's hope we don't have to deal with any more of those clowns...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_INTRO_0,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_INTRO_1,"BELIEVE me, I tried. Stupid helmet wouldn't fit on my head! I guess all that metal manipulation made Magneto's head shrink."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_INTRO_2,"Eh, screw it. I LOVE this\nRocket Launcher! That's a classic Earth-style shotgun, too.\nYou should keep it."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_INTRO_3,"I am Groot. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_INTRO_4,"Next stop, a Dark Watch warehouse run by a corrupted Captain America. Time to get me that shield..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_START_0,"Here's the deal, Captain Corruption: you're gonna toss me that shield nice and slow."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_START_1,Or I'm gonna blast you and your merc buddies to bits.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_START_2,"Fat chance, raccoon.\nIf I'm tossing this shield..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_START_3,It's only to bounce it off your tiny head and back into my hands.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_MID_0,"Seize them! For the glory of Ultimus! "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_MID_1,"Oh geez, this just got a whole lot more dicey..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_DP_0,"Maybe this was a bad idea, Groot. These guys just keep coming... There's no way we can get out of here on our own!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_DP_1,"Who said you're on your own? "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_DP_2,"Yeah, animal cruelty is a crime. Can't have that... NOT ON MY WATCH. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_DP_3,I can't believe I'm actually happy to see Deadpool.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_END_0,I AM GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_END_1,"You're telling me! You really saved our hides back there, Deadpool & Spider-dude. We owe you big time!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_END_2,I accept wine and scented candles as gifts. And unicorn plushies...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_03_END_3,"Also gift cards to Bedlam, Beast, and Beyonder."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_0,"OK, OK, I know, this MIGHT be a little overkill. But you gotta admit..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_1,"Sniper Rifle plus Riot Shield equals totally AWESOME, am I right? Hey... where'd you find those stun batons?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_3,"Just some random bag?\nWhose bag, Groot?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_4,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_5,"Yeesh. Glad she wasn't using those in that last fight! Those things make my hair all frizzy. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_6,Just got word that Hydra is gonna arm a missile to destroy-- you know what? Doesn't matter. They suck and their evil plots are always stupid.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_7,"We're gonna go blow up their base and steal their stuff. They've got a Winter Soldier running the show, apparently."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_INTRO_8,Finally... I'm gonna get that arm.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_START_0," ..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_START_1,"Big man with the big arm. Not much of a talker, huh? How about you, scowly? "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_START_2,"Want to know what you are? Fair game.\nIt's hunting season, raccoon."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_MID_0,Magneto? What the heck are you doing in this neck of the woods?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_MID_1,I wanted to show my appreciation for your efforts in eliminating that corrupted Brotherhood faction.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_MID_2,And I never tire of disposing of Hydra filth...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_END_0,So I tried on your helmet... Didn't fit.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_END_1,Did you? Perhaps your head is too... fluffy? If you considered shaving--
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_04_END_2,NOPE.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_INTRO_0,"I. Am. The Punisher! Scary, right?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_INTRO_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_INTRO_2,"Heh, yeah. These Hydra jerks have pretty fancy gear. Gonna make a good add to our haul!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_INTRO_3,"I've been coordinating our next heist with Gamora and Nebula, and it's a doozy! "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_INTRO_4,"We're gonna hit a base on Mars run by corrupted Thanos, Yondu, and Ultron. It's gonna be epic."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_START_0,Corrupted space pirates use this base as a critical waypoint to Earth.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_START_1,"Use your destructive talents to obliterate their base, and you can take whatever you want, Rocket."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_MID_0,Oh GOOD! Un-corrupted members of S.T.R.I.K.E. are here! And JUST in time for my latest experiment...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_MID_1,"Keep your janky gadgets away from us, lady!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_MID_2,"You're not a guinea pig, but you'll suffice. COMMENCE THE SCIENCE!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_END_0,"We're so pleased you were able to be here for this experiment! "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_END_1,Behold. My newest multi-phasic Cavorite-infused transportation device... Let's see where it takes us!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_05_END_2,DON'T YOU--
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_0,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_1,"Ow, my brain! Where are we? What happened to Gamora and Nebula."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_2,"I hope they're okay. That blast was frickin' weird. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_4,"Knowing Scientist Supreme, that thing probably jumbled up time and space, or something. We could be anywhere."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_5,Hi.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_6," ..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_INTRO_7,"I know. I'm speechless, TOO. We're all so stunningly handsome."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_START_0,"Heya, Wasp. So... Deadpool tells me we're on Tiny World? I mean, uh... YOUR world. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_START_1,Rocket Raccoon! How did you end up back here with us?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_START_2,"While I'd LOVE to sit around and catch up with you guys, there's a horde of angry, corrupted super villains headed our way."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_MID_0,"My experiment worked! Not only did my device teleport us to a random location in the multiverse, but it also resulted in a mass reduction to--"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_MID_1,FALSE. ERROR. DOES NOT COMPUTE.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_MID_2,"Sorry, professor. Gotta CLAP BACK at you on this one. Send us home, or we're gonna put you in a hurt locker. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_0,"Ugh. Fine fine fine, you win. Nobody ever APPRECIATES my brilliance."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_1,All you have to do is stand within 25 meters of the device. When I hit this button it will bring us back to my lab.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_2,"Yeah, like I'm gonna let you do it.\nHand it over. Also, how the heck did Deadpool get here?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_3,No idea. It's a mystery!\nA mystery of SCIENCE.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_4," ..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_5,"Wasp, it's time for us to go big and go home. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_6,"We'll keep fighting the good fight here at home. Go get 'em, big guy."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_01_END_7,"You hear that, Groot?\nShe called me ""big guy!"""
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_INTRO_0,This little gadget will send a message right to them! Now to fire it up.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_INTRO_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_INTRO_2,"Do NOT tell me we're back in Tiny World. \n\n And I don't want to hear, ""I told you so,"" either!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_INTRO_3,Why did you both come back? We need to get out of here!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_INTRO_4,"Too late, Hope. Kang's lackeys are on us!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_START_0,You'll never guess what we found at Doom's place.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_START_1,Can we talk about it AFTER we're done being attacked?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_END_0,"Like I was saying, Doom had a stash of Pym Particles, and I swiped them."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_END_1,"Rocket, that's fantastic news!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_END_2,We used the last of our Pym Particles to get our daughter out of here after our last fight.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_END_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_02_END_4,I know... There goes our payday.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_INTRO_0,Just take the Particles already. I need to forget about all the cash we lost on this deal.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_INTRO_1,I know how that feels.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_INTRO_2,This will be more than enough for us to get back home. You saved us!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_INTRO_3,"Oh, I wouldn't say that just yet."
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_START_0,The resistance ends with you!
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_END_0,How are you both going to get back?
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_END_2,We got in here with this... thing. I'm pretty sure it can get us out.
ID_DIALOG_TU_AM_WA_RR_GR_03_END_3,"How about we all blow this joint, then?"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_0,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_1,"Yeah, Scientist Supreme is a few tritium crystals short of a star drive. On the bright side..."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_2,I have a laser sword. I actually. Have. A laser sword.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_3,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_4,Our next target is a Kree Warship in orbit run by a corrupted Loki. Doctor Strange and Thor are gonna help us board it.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_INTRO_5,"Ever since Thor had that eyepatch, he's been acting like a space pirate. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_START_0,"Don't forget, guys. That helmet and staff of Loki's... They're both MINE."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_START_1,"Rocket, you may take ALL the spoils from this battle. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_START_2,The opportunity to fight Loki is all the reward I require.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_END_1,Seriously. I feel like I'm gonna be seeing an endless stream of Loki clones in my sleep.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_06_END_2,"At least we got the goods. Only one more stop, then we've got enough stuff to meet with our special friend. We're almost there!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_0,Dude's gonna LOVE this Kree tech.\nGot a big ole pile of it now!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_1,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_2,"Don't worry, this last heist is gonna be an easy one. I promise."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_4,"It's not gonna be EASY, but it's definitely not gonna be impossible."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_5,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_6,"Groot, you know I love Quill, but he's way off on this one. It's going to be REALLY DIFFICULT."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_7,I am GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_8,"No kidding, Groot. With Quill and Yondu on our side, we've GOT this. All we gotta do is steal a corrupted Nick Fury's eyepatch."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_INTRO_9,How hard could THAT be?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_START_0,I AM GROOT.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_START_1,"No, I will not ""just give it you."" If you want this eyepatch, you're gonna have to take it off my dead body."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_START_2,"Yep, that about sums it up."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_0,"We did it, Groot! We've got the full list."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_1,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_2,"Time to meet with the man himself. Be cool. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_3," --"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_4,Rocket Raccoon. My operatives inform me that you have acquired a... substantial stockpile of rare antiquities in your recent conquests.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_5,I have. Heard you lost your national treasures when Ultimus attacked Latveria. I can help you restock your vaults... in return for a small favor.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_6,DOOM is intrigued. Continue...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_7,A samophlange. Even folks as far as Knowhere have heard wonders about Latverian samophlanges.\nI could use one.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_8,One? Very well. You may take ONE. You will be granted access to my vault to take the one that best suits your needs. Doom agrees to this deal.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_9,"Thank you for your generosity,\nMr. Doctor Doom. Let's go, Groot. "
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_10,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_11,"You think we should make a copy of Doom's transdimensional map while we're in there? Sure, why not."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_07_END_12,And I am definitely taking AT LEAST\na dozen samophlanges...
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_INTRO_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_INTRO_1,"Yeah, it was pretty dumb of Doom to leave us alone in his vault."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_INTRO_2,"Apologies, my friends, but the bounties Doom placed on your heads are too great for the Ravagers to ignore."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_INTRO_3,I hope we have enough firepower for this fight.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_INTRO_4,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_END_0,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_END_1,Don't look at me! I only took the samophlanges.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_END_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_08_END_3,Okay. Maybe I also liberated Doom's stash of Pym Particles.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_INTRO_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_INTRO_1,I haven't gone soft! Ant-Man and Wasp would pay to keep these out of Doom's hands.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_INTRO_2,You both need to come with us. Now.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_INTRO_3,How do these wackos keep finding us?
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_START_0,"Gamora, don't tell me this joker made you into a soulless flunky."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_END_0,"Now that they're out of our hair, we need to figure out how to signal Ant-man and Wasp in Tiny World."
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_END_2,"Jeeze, have a little faith in me!"
ID_DIALOG_TU_RR_GR_09_END_3,"All I need to do is get ahold of some spare parts, and they'll be here in no time."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_0,"While S.T.R.I.K.E. was on Hala battling Ultimus, Doctor Doom sealed off the Nexus Reality, claiming Earth for his own."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_1,"From his base on a stolen warship, Nick Fury deploys S.T.R.I.K.E. to search for technology that will help them return home…."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_2,There is a nearby universe that is ruled by Ultron. He's harnessing an energy I've never seen. We could possibly use it to get back home.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_3,"Outstanding. T'Challa, take a team, get in, and get back safe and sound."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_4,LATER...
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_5,Fascinating! Ultron has been quite busy. He has found a way to combine Kree Red Orb technology with his army!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_6,The energy contained in these Red Orbs are making his drones stronger in almost every way.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_7,"Even if we cannot repurpose this technology, it's too dangerous for us to allow him to keep it."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_INTRO_8,"Agreed. Gather what you can, we will destroy whatever we cannot use."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_START_0,"Halt! Human life form detected! You shall be annihilated by his Supreme Ruler, Ultimate Ultron."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_START_1,What do we do now?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_START_2,Let's take their Red Orbs!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_END_0,"These Red Orbs are already coded to Ultron's drones, but look how stable they are!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_01_END_1,Looks like we will have to go to the source and get one right off the production line.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_INTRO_0,"Shuri! We are here with the orb generator. What do you need us to do? "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_INTRO_1,"Buy me some time. I'll reprogram the production facility to generate an orb with uncoded energy. "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_INTRO_2,Stop! Intruders! Prepare to be taken to Ultron Prime for analyzation.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_INTRO_3,More robots. This is our reward for fighting in a robot factory.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_START_0,"The process is almost complete. The anti-entropy algorithms are elegant, but they take time to execute. "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_START_1,You can say that again. Hurry up!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_MID_0,"All done! I've made the energy samples. Fight your way to the Quinjet and I'll fly us out of here. "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_0,I've analyzed the orbs from the factory. They were engineered to only interact with inorganic beings. You know… robots.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_1,Is there any way around it? Can you repurpose them to work with humans?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_2,"Ultron put contingencies in place. In the event of someone manipulating the Red Orbs, they are set to destabilize their containment fields."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_3,"Which will result in all nearby Red Orbs doing the same... "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_4,"...ending in a chain reaction that will create a tachyon pulse with a 5,000-megaton yield. "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_5,That sounds... bad.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_6,"I found something else. Mister Fantastic imprinted his signature in the algorithm that stabilizes these Red Orbs. "
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_7,"Only, this is a corrupted Mister Fantastic who rules his own universe from an extremely fancy laboratory."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_8,"Okoye, navigate us to DOC-8, the universe ruled by Reed Richards and where everyone has an IQ of at least 160."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_02_END_9,Uhhh...
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_0,"I'm delaying Mister Fantastic's security as best I can, but you need to be quick, brother. I do not know how long I can keep this up."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_1,Any idea where the experimental Red Orbs might be?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_2,"Yes, his network is saying they were archived and stored in Warehouse 13 along with some terrifying artifacts."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_3,Sending the directions to your Kimoyo Beads. Hurry!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_4,These orbs can be used on humans? You're certain?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_INTRO_5,"According to the notes I'm stealing, yes. But we have to see for ourselves."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_START_0,"Pathetic! You fools can't create your own technology, so you're regressing to a physical confrontation."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_START_1,How dare you insult the might of Wakanda!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_START_2,"I was insulting your intellect, you simpleton! But if you insist, allow me to demonstrate true might!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_END_0,But a minor setback. My army is too vast for the likes of S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_END_1,Mister Fantastic is teleporting more of his army to our location. Quit messing around and get the tech!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_END_2,"I'm overpowering one of your Kimoyo Beads, it will act like a short-range EMP."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_03_END_3,It should give you enough time to shut down his teleporter and get back to our ship before you get overwhelmed!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_START_0,"When I tell you, throw the bead into the teleporter to knock it out!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_START_1,But first we need to clear a path to it.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_START_2,"My army is too vast for you, king! You have proven that the Omniverse needs to be rebuilt in your better's image. My image."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_START_3,Lay down your primitive weapons and surrender!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_0,No one can stand up to the might of Wakanda!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_1,"Okoye, get ready to shut his infernal contraption off."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_2,3...2...1...
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_3,I see why Mister Fantastic had these in storage; they were only partially completed. Seems like he lost interest halfway into creating them.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_4,"So, all of that was for nothing?"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_5,Not necessarily. While analyzing these I was able to synchronize their energy signature.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_6,"According to records, some of these were shipped elsewhere. If I am reading this right, it has been integrated with organic life!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_7,Looks like we have one more stop to make.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_8,"Okoye, please navigate us to Mister Sinister's universe, X3R-0X."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_04_END_9,How many times will we let that twisted clone betray us? Don't let him talk this time.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_0,His security is surprisingly lax. Keep your eyes out for anything that isn't normal.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_1,Is there anything about this place that is normal?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_2,"M'Baku is right. The faster we leave, the better."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_3,"Shuri, access the network and see if you can find where the Red Orbs are. I don't want to spend any more time here than necessary."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_4,"No need, I programmed my gauntlets to track the energy signature. According to them, the energy is all around us."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_INTRO_5,Look out! Ambush!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_START_0,Welcome to my laboratory. We can find a permanent place for you in my army as soon as we integrate these Red Orbs into your primitive cortexes.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_START_1,There they are! Defeat the clones and we can get the Red Orbs!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_END_0,Fascinating. Fighting you is giving me innumerable data points on how to better my creations.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_END_1,Does that mean what I think it means?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_05_END_2,"If you think it means that he is learning how we fight and is making the next wave of clones harder to beat, then yes."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_INTRO_0,"You defeated my first wave, but how will you fare against the next?"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_INTRO_1,"Shuri, do something! We cannot keep this up all day!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_INTRO_2,"Oh, fear not, your highness. You won't live through the day anyway."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_END_0,"I am starting to tire of this. Shuri, disable his control switch before he activates more clones!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_END_1,"I cannot simply pull a plug, brother! He has a techno-organic shield protecting the switch!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_END_2,"Wait... actually, it may be that easy. If I can reconfigure a few Kimoyo Beads to..."
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_06_END_3,"I don't care what you need to do, just do it!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_START_0,Done! Just toss this bead at the machine and it should short circuit!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_START_1,We just need to get past... all of them.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_0,No! This cannot be! You have ruined my beautiful creations!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_1,"Good work, sister. Killmonger, M'Baku, grab the Red Orbs, and let's leave this wretched place!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_2,ONBOARD NICK FURY'S STOLEN KREE WARSHIP...
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_3,The energy in these Red Orbs is fascinating! I believe we can harness it to make our allies even stronger!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_4,I thought S.T.R.I.K.E. has been utilizing a red energy already?
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_5,Not like this! Earlier energy took advantage of Scarlet Witch's chaos magic.
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_6,That's why it was so unpredictable!
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_7,"Yes! While this energy may not help us get home, when we do finally arrive in the Nexus, we will be much stronger!"
ID_DIALOG_FLASH_WAKANDA_07_END_8,Doctor Doom will not know what hit him.

ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_0,"Director Fury, we've received intel that a Red Skull from another Earth is recruiting for an army that spans dimensions."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_1,Yes. He sent his Baron Zemo as an emissary in an attempt to procure my talents.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_2,"Why didn't you bring this to our attention sooner, Zemo?"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_3,I was hoping to ascertain more information then present it to you with a plan.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_4,"Well, the plan now is to go on the offensive."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_5,"You're an expert at fighting alongside Hydra, but this mission also needs an expert fighting against them."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_6,"Sam, you wanted a shot at leadership? No time like the present. Take Cap as back up. Barnes and Zemo as well."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_7,"So what's the play, Sam?"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_INTRO_8,They wanted to meet Zemo. Let's not disappoint them.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_START_0,You were instructed to come alone.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_START_1,"You will regret not joining our new, multidimensional army!"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_START_2,"Boy, that's a mouthful."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_MID_0,"Hail Hydra! Cut off one head, two more shall take its place!"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_MID_1,If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that line...
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_END_0,"I was a fool to come to you, Baron Zemo."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_01_END_1,You've grown weak working alongside S.T.R.I.K.E.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_INTRO_0,"Were the roles reversed, I would not deign to travel to this dimension without several peons to provide support."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_INTRO_1,Then let's assume there's another team waiting for Zemo's return...
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_INTRO_2,Along with a portal to return to wherever they came from.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_INTRO_3,I've got a plan they won't see coming.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_INTRO_4,A good leader listens to his team. So let's hear this plan...
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_START_0,Hail Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_START_1,Hail multidimensional Hydra...?
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_START_2,Did you really think that would work? Your eyes aren't glowing.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_START_3,Last time I delegate to you.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_START_4,I really hate you.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_MID_0,Hail multidimensional Hydra!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_MID_1,HA! I knew it!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_MID_2,I hate you...
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_END_0,"Well, the portal is still intact. Nice work, Sam."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_END_1,Barnes's plan kinda worked. It confused them for a second.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_END_2,Every second you stand here congratulating yourselves is a second lost to Red Skull's machinations.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_END_3,The man has a point.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_02_END_4,Let's take this portal and bring the pain to Red Skull.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_0,"Ah, S.T.R.I.K.E. You are a bit earlier than I had anticipated, but nevertheless, you are predictable."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_1,"Bah! Capitalizing on the defeat of Ultimus? Now that is truly a predictable and pedantic move, Red Skull."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_2,"Hydra is prepared to lead not just one dimension, but all dimensions. My army grows stronger by the day."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_3,We've already dispatched your leaders. Not so strong now.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_4,"You stopped my soldiers from one dimension, yes. But the legion of Hydra are as endless as the multiverse!"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_5,HAIL!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_INTRO_6,HYDRA!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_START_0,"Game faces on, S.T.R.I.K.E. This won't be easy."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_START_1,Fighting Hydra never is.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_START_2,Cut off one head -
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_START_3,We know!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_END_0,We've vanquished Red Skull. Such a resounding victory should extinguish the idea of a multidimensional Hydra.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_END_1,"Nice work, Sam.\nI knew you could do it."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_END_2,Yeah. You managed to wrap this up pretty quickly compared to other S.T.R.I.K.E. operations.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_MEC_FA_WS_03_END_3,This was just a minor victory. The war with Hydra isn't over.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_0,"Natasha! Assemble your team, I just got word of a factory in Serbia that's drawing far too much power."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_1,You think it's another corrupt facility?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_2,Mhmm. They seem to be popping up more and more recently. Wonder what changed.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_3,We're on it.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_4,"NOVI SAD, SERBIA..."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_5,"Alexei, watch our six. Yelena..."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_6,"Nonsense! I lead this, malish. Now everyone follow me, the building looks clear."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_7,The fence even has that death robot symbol on it. No one could be inside!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_8,Alexei! No! That's Ultron's symbol. This factory is...
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_INTRO_9,... a trap.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_START_0,"Hahaha, not to worry, malish. No robot can stop us!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_START_1,"What part of ""covert mission"" didn't you understand?"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_0,"Wait until Fury hears about this! You could have jeopardized the entire mission. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_1,Jeopardize? Everything worked out perfectly! Hahaha.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_2,Those blundering fools. These missions should have been ours! We are the superior spies!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_3,So what are you gonna do about it?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_4,"If Fury doesn't see how useless and incompetent they are, we will just have to show him!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_5,"I'll use one of my illusions to pose as Fury, and send them on a very special mission... "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_01_END_6,"And after they've torn each other apart, Mysterio will be on top again!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_0,Natasha! Alexei! What part of covert didn't you two understand?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_1,The plan was...
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_2,"I don't have time for your excuses! I'm sending you all back to basic training. Report to Taskmaster's Academy ASAP. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_3,"One more thing. Taskmaster's blocking all comms until you complete his courses. Now get out of my sight. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_4,This is proving to be easier than I expected. The fools won't know what hit 'em.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_5,TASKMASTER'S ACADEMY...
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_6,"Alright, you maggots! Welcome to your remedial courses!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_7,"Watch it, Taskmaster. I am still your superior officer!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_INTRO_8,You're in need of some remedial courses in manners!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_START_0,Show me that you deserve to be Fury's numero uno spy team.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_START_1,DEFEAT THE MARKED TARGETS TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT COURSE.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_END_0,"Huh, you actually looked like a team out there. That's gotta be a fluke."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_02_FAIL_0,"Ha! Yeah, I didn't expect the likes of you to be able to complete my courses!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_INTRO_0,"Alright, regroup, and then it's time for your next lesson."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_INTRO_1,"Taskmaster, this is a waste of everyone's time. We've been working together for years."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_INTRO_2,Just pass us so we can get back to work.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_INTRO_3,"Bah! You've been on the same team, but I haven't seen you work together once! "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_INTRO_4,"Now hit the training course, unless you want me to tell Fury you're disobeying orders."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_START_0,"Defeat the new marked targets to move onto the next course. If you can stop fighting each other long enough to, that is!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_START_1,DEFEAT THE MARKED TARGETS TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT COURSE.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_END_0,"Hrm. Red Guardian, Yelena... Good work. I guess. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_END_1,How do those incompetent fools keep beating my traps?!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_END_2,There's something off about Taskmaster. He isn't acting like himself.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_03_END_3,Crazy? Mean? Seems fine to me. What's wrong 'Tasha? Don't like some friendly competition?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_INTRO_0,"I'm serious, something doesn't feel right here..."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_INTRO_1,You're being paranoid. I think you're just upset that he said we did well.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_INTRO_2,Maybe when we graduate I will be made the official team lead after all! Hahaha!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_INTRO_3,The Widow is on to you. If she figures out what we're doing...
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_INTRO_4,"Don't worry, there is no way they will get through this next mission together!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_START_0,Let's see how you do against these new LMDs.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_0,"Incredible, you succeeded again. You're not at each other's throats, either. Huh. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_1,"You almost sound like you WANT us to fail. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_2,"What? No! Of course not. I'm just, surprised by how well you all act like a team. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_3,Not at all what I've seen on the security tapes of your last few missions.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_4,Why were you reviewing our security tapes?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_5,"Uh... Fury! Fury sent them over, of course, so I could tailor these courses just for you! "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_6,Makes sense to me. On to the next challenge!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_04_END_7,PHEW.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_0,There's definitely something wrong here. I've been noticing a weird energy surge every time we start a training scenario.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_1,"Getting this many LMDs has got to be drawing power from somewhere, I'm sure it's standard."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_2,"Not possible. After Taskmaster joined S.T.R.I.K.E., Iron Man upgraded all the security and power systems here. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_3,Taskmaster should know the power limits. I don't think that's actually Taskmaster.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_4,Who would it be? And why would they trap us here?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_5,"I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Follow my lead."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_INTRO_6,"Decent work so far, but how will you fair juggling multiple objectives at once!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_START_0,"Watch for the flicker, I'll try to trigger a power surge to short circuit the simulation."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_START_1,"What?! How were you able to overload my circuitry! No matter, you won't succeed."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_MID_0,Mysterio! You were behind this? Stop him before he gets away!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_END_0,"Alright, you caught me. I give up."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_END_1,I should have known it was you. This reeked of your shoddy gadgets.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_END_2,"I knew it was him all along, of course! Well done, malish."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_05_END_3,"Alexi, you were the most fooled out of all of us."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_0,"What was the point of all this, Mysterio?"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_1,Isn't it obvious? I should be Fury's go-to for espionage!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_2,"With all the tech at my disposal, I'm set up to be the world's best spy! "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_3,"Yet he always gives you blundering fools all the fun assignments! I have to sit in a surveillance van! A VAN! "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_4,You've gone mad!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_5,"Maybe, but it's from watching your team get all the praise!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_INTRO_6,"My traps may not have gotten rid of you, but I know my team will!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_START_0,"Once my team is through with you, Fury will have no choice but to give all the plum assignments to me! Hahaha!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_START_1,"This is crazy, even for Mysterio. Something else is happening here… Be on your guard. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_END_0,Enough! I tire of little cat and mouse game!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_END_1,"Who are you working with, Mysterio?"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_END_2,"""With?"" Oh, darling, don't make me laugh. I wouldn't ever work ""with"" this little disaster of a man. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_END_3,"Manipulate him, though? Use him? Make him an unwitting pawn? "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_06_END_4,"You KNOW I'm up for that. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_0,Mister Sinister?!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_1,Why would you do this? We saved you from that frozen lab!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_2,Saved me?! You clods ruined my life's work when you came charging in!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_3,"I've been biding my time, waiting for the perfect moment to make you pay for destroying my experiments."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_4,"After I destroy you all, I can finally focus on my work again! I'll become the best Sinister clone there is!"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_5,"Sorry, Mysterio. I stand corrected - HE has gone mad. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_INTRO_6,"Finally, something we can agree on. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_START_0,How touching! Too bad your newly found comradery will all be for naught.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_START_1,"Now, are we going to stand around gabbing, or are we going to fight?"
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_START_2,"Team, let's show this maniac what we've learned here. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_0,"Dasvidaniya, tovarish Sinister."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_1,"Comms are up. I'm calling in evac, and a containment pod for Sinister and Mysterio."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_2,Natasha? Yelena? Where have you been!
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_3,Dealing with a rogue Mister Sinister. We've been trapped here at Taskmaster's school.
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_4,"Thanks to Natasha, we were able to discover the ploy and apprehend Sinister before too much damage was done."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_5,"I expected nothing less from my best team. Now, pack light and grab your sunscreen. "
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_6,Are you sending us on vacation finally?
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_7,"Very amusing, Alexei. Wheels up in 10. Getting some strange weather readings over the Sahara."
ID_DIALOG_FE_SKILLITARY_07_END_8,So much for that vacation.

ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_0,"Okay, gang. The Milano's approaching the big weird floating head thing that's making a beeline to Earth now. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_1,How in the flark did a dead Celestial head show up in our solar system anyway?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_2,"That's what Fury sent us to find out. I just wish we had our, uh, usual crew. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_3,"Outer space, at last. Finally, room enough for Otto Octavius's reach to match his ambition. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_4,"Ugh, there's barely even enough room on this ship for your ego, Otto. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_5,"Sue's right, Peter. Why are we bringing him, again?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_6,"Everyone's bringing different skills to the table. You can phase, Sue can stealth. Ock knows tech. And Rocket..."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_7,"BUCKLE UP, I'm blowin' a hole in the side of this head and we're charging right through!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_INTRO_8,Does THAT. Hold on to something!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_START_0,"Hey Rocket, how about a heads up before you detonate something next time?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_START_1,"But then how would I get to see the stupid look on your pink human face, Quill?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_START_2,I hope it was worth waking up the weird alien guard dogs in this place! Incoming!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_0,"More Symbiotes! Even in the dark of space, I can't be rid of the infernal spider. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_1,"So, now that we're inside... What is this place?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_2,"Celestials are great big god things. This one's been dead a while. Its head got turned into a pretty cool bar. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_3,"He means a spaceport. It was called Knowhere. The problem is, Ronan blew up Knowhere."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_4,So where did this one come from?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_5,"It stands to reason, given everything we've seen, its origins are interdimensional. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_01_END_6,"Probably. But I'm less worried about where it came from, and more worried about why it's here now. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_INTRO_0,"So here's the plan. Rocket blew a hole in the face of this thing, so we make our way up to the brain hole."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_INTRO_1,The brain hole?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_INTRO_2,"I mean, this place is hollowed out, so there's not a BRAIN there anymore. So, brain hole. Because, you know... Brain."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_INTRO_3,"You used to go out with this guy, huh? "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_INTRO_4,"I was figuring some things out, okay?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_START_0,"Ah, the intruders. You dispatched our Symbiotes, but you'll find us a bit more formidable. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_0,"Ock, help Invisible Woman keep these guys under wraps until we figure out our next move. But no killing!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_1,I don't understand why you brought me along only to reduce my effectiveness! I could have broken them into parts.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_2,"Oooh, you know what, he's making some good points, Quill!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_3,"Gee, thanks for the support, Rocket."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_4," Just keep restraining them, no one's ""breaking"" anyone. Okay? "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_5,"Very well. When you're torn apart by foes I could have easily killed, I hope your conscience rests easy. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_02_END_6,This is a fun group.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_0,"The cosmic minerals lining this place, their value is immeasurable. The experiments I could conduct with them..."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_1,"Yeah, the insides of a space god are weird. And they fetch a pretty penny out here."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_2,"Before I became a full-time galaxy-guarder, hoo boy, I would killed to get my hands on this stuff. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_3,"Well, as someone looking to steal this stuff, I certainly hope it does not come to killing. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_4,"Now, place your weapons on the ground, and you can have the honor of saying you were captured by the legendary Star-Lord. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_INTRO_5,WAIT. WHO?!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_START_0,"My Ravagers and I are hoping to make a quiet getaway, but you and your friends are simply drawing too much attention."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_START_1,"I am very sorry, but we are going to have to subdue you."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_START_2,"Hey Quill, if it's okay with you, I'm gonna go with this guy."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_0,"Okay, you've got Element Gun moves..."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_1,...But can you dance?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_2,"A classic distraction technique. But I cannot allow it to deter me. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_3,"The materials in this Celestial will allow me and the Ravagers to do much good in the galaxy. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_4,"Ravagers doing GOOD? Okay, now I KNOW this guy's from another dimension. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_5,"Another dimension? "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_6,"Yeah, pal. This is the Nexus Dimension -- I think you're pretty far from home."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_7,"This is troubling. Ravagers, this Celestial can wait. We need to learn more about what has happened."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_03_END_8,"Apologies, lesser Star-Lord. Perhaps our paths will cross again one day. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_0,"Okay, what's the plan now,\n""Lesser Star-Lord""?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_1,"As team leader, I do not approve of that nickname."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_2,Here's the thing - whoever those magic users we dealt with were are clearly working for someone higher up.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_3,"So we keep pushing, we find them, get answers, snag some sweet tech for S.T.R.I.K.E., and get out. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_4,"That's more of an overview than a plan, Peter."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_INTRO_5,Right. So... Stick to the overview. Let's go.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_START_0,Are the station's weapons back online yet?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_START_1,The dimensional jump drained the grid... Soon they'll be powered up and ready for destruction.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_START_2,Destruction's kinda my thing. Want a demonstration?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_0,Did the Knowhere in our world have weapons?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_1,"No way, I woulda known about it and ripped them off for sure."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_2,"Someone took Knowhere and turned it into a flying interdimensional Death-lestial. Great. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_3,The engineering... It's magnificent.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_4,"Yeah, magnificently terrifying! Can you break it?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_5,"Any idiot can break it! But I, Otto Octavius, can make it so it can never be fixed again. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_04_END_6,"Watch, cretins, as my many arms do their incredible work!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_0,"There! I've disabled this station's offensive weapons beyond repair. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_1,"And, in my genius, I interfaced with Knowhere's mainframe. I've found a path directly to the control center. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_2,You were able to do all that without being detected?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_3,"Child, I was brought along on this mission for my technical expertise. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_4,Whose intellect could possibly match mine?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_INTRO_5,"Ah, it's our problem stowaways. Once we destroy you, I can have our weapons system fixed in no time. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_START_0,"This group is a more disparate one than I expected. I expect no great challenge for to remove you from the equation. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_START_1,"This guy's twice as arrogant as my Reed and about half as charming. Let's take him out. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_0,Blast! Richards managed to reassemble most of the machine before we defeated him. This will... take some time.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_1,"Time we don't have. Sorry, Doc."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_2,BZZZT!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_3,What did you do?!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_4,I phased through the circuits. Shuts it down for good.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_5,Why didn't you simply do this before?!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_05_END_6,"Well, we wouldn't want me getting in the way of your GENIUS, would we? Let's go. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_0,"Okay, if Ock's intel is right, we're just outside the heart of the station. Which is, you know... the brain."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_1,"The brain hole, you mean."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_2,"Where the bad guys are, alright? Jeez, you guys are worse than Gamora. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_3,This place must have been abandoned for a while before they took it over. Look at all the flarkin' cobwebs!
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_4,Rodent. Did you say... webs?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_INTRO_5,"String them up, Spiders! "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_START_0,"Take them apart! We're almost to Earth, we can't let them stop us here!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_0,"Finally, something I excel at -- pulling the legs off spiders. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_1,"Hey! We talked about this! Yeesh, you're a murderous creep, Otto."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_2,"So, why don't YOU tell us what's going on before I get out of the way of this murderous creep?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_3,Knowhere... It's going to destroy your Earth... And make way for Ultimus...
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_4,"Hey, Ding Dongs! Did you not get the memo? Ultimus is beat!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_5,"Then instead we will avenge him. Either way... Your world is forfeit. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_06_END_6,"Aw, crap. Eternals. I hate these guys. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_0,"With our intimate knowledge of the Celestials, Sersi and I were able to convert Knowhere to this..."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_1,"A floating battle station, with enough Celestial energy to destroy Nexus Earth and claim this dimension for Ultimus."
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_2,"Didn't you get the news?\nUltimus is gone! "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_3,"So, instead of the blowing up a whole planet thing, why don't you turn this giant head around go home?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_4,"He will return. And when he does, Knowhere will sit as his throne in the center of the Nexus!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_INTRO_5,"Nice job, Quill! Anyone ever tell you that you got a real way with words!"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_START_0,"You face agents of a Celestial, servants of Ultimus, in the center of their place of power. How can you stand against us?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_START_1,I've got a raccoon who likes to blow stuff up. I mostly just get out of his way.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_0,We beat a couple of Eternals?! We're still alive?! I did NOT see that coming.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_1,"If I'm being honest, me neither. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_2,"Now, what do we do with this place?"
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_3,"We should claim it for our own! Think of the things I... I mean S.T.R.I.K.E. could accomplish with this firepower. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_4,"The last thing you need is access to a giant, planet-destroying space station, Ock. "
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_5,Load up Ultimus's leftover goons into the Milano's brig. We'll bring them back to Fury. And Rocket...?
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_6,Set this place to blow. We're gonna ride out of here with a hell of an explosion behind us.
ID_DIALOG_MFE_KNOWHERE_07_END_7,"I knew there was a reason I kept you around, Quill."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_INTRO_0,Welcome you spineless worms to a special <size=90>TWO WEEKS ONLY</size> multiversal mayhem event!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_INTRO_1,That's right! You undeserving filth have been begging for this and you're <size=90>FINALLY</size> getting it!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_INTRO_2,I give to you. The <size=90>ONE</size>. The <size=90>ONLY</size>. <size=90>GAMBIT!!!</size>
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_INTRO_3,"Since I'm forced to be here anyways. Out of the spotlight Mojo, ain't nobody wanna see you. But as for you, my adorin' fans."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_INTRO_4,"Gambit is here, ma chere."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_A_START_0,"For your <size=90>FIRST</size> fight, what better match would it be for the audience than the X-Men's biggest rivals? The infamous <size=90>BROTHERHOOOOOOOOOD!</size>"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_A_START_1,"Brotherhood, eh? They'll make for a good warmup for Gambit. Bring 'em on!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_A_START_2,I'm lookin' forward to wiping the floor with your pretty-boy face!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_A_END_0,"Congratulations for the honor of being beat by yours truly. Who's next, Mojo? "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_A_END_1,Not bad for an <size=90>OLD</size> dog. Let's see if you know any new tricks! Bring in the <size=90>NEXT</size> group.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_B_START_0,"Hey Gambit, do you remember when you were pals with the Marauders? <size=90>No?</size> Good! Neither do they! <size=90>HAHAHAHAHAHA!</size>."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_B_START_1,I've been lookin' forward to this for ages. Time to finish what I started!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_B_START_2,"You're all roar and no claws, Creed. Let's go, Housecat."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_B_END_0,"After all dis time, and I still manage to impress myself."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_B_END_1,These ratings aren't half <size=90>BAD</size> either. Years of kidnapping X-Men and you're finally making it worth it!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_0,"For anyone who missed the <size=90>RERUNS</size>, our intrepid hero here started off as a petty thief before getting the boot from the Thieves Guild! "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_1,How untrustworthy do you have to be to get <size=90>KICKED OUT</size> of a THIEVES guild?! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_2,"Keep talkin', Mojo, and Gambit will show you just how untrustworthy he can be..."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_3,I...uhh... J-j-j-just start the fight! Street rat versus street thugs!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_4,"You, Cajun rat, will never be good enough for Marie! I'll make sure you never get near her again!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M1_C_START_5,"Rogue's a grown woman, it's 'bout time you stop trying to control her!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_A_END_0,"As much as I love Rogue, I'm glad you're not actually my mother-in-law."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_B_START_0,<size=90>MARAUDERS</size> you have <size=90>ONE</size> last chance to prove yourselves!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_B_START_1,"Mojo, if I didn' know better, I'd think you wanted me to fail."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_B_END_0,I'm jus' gettin' warmed up!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_C_START_0,I'm tired of your thieves messin' up my city. Time to clean up the streets!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_C_START_1,"Ah, but I'm so much more den a thief... I'm an X-Men."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M3_C_END_0,"Might wanna keep trainin', Luke. I didn' even break a sweat."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_0,"<size=90>BIG</size> round of applause to your <size=90>FAVORITE</size> gladiator!!! "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_1,"You've seen him go head to head with his old gangs, but now you'll get to see what his metal is really made of!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_2,Mojo! You told me dis was going to be a quick few rounds and Gambit will be outta here!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_3,"Don't you know it's <size=90>TACKY</size> to talk about contracts on air! "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_4,You shoulda read the fine print more carefully! You're my main attraction for <size=90>TWO</size> weeks! <size=90>THEN</size> your debt to me is paid off.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_5,Not like you really had a CHOICE in signing!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_6,"All this for stealin' a little six-armed baby, from you. Who knew you were the sentimental type, eh?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_INTRO_7,<size=90>Enough</size>! Get back in the ring or I'll add more time to your contract!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_A_START_0,Let's see how Gambit's hand stacks up against this next opponent!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_A_START_1,"Dat you, Magneto? How'd Mojo trap you in here?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_A_START_2,"I'm not your Magneto, and you're not my Gambit. But I guess teaching one of you a lesson in magnetism will have to suffice!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_A_END_0,"Is dat all Magneto's got for Gambit? I thought you wanted a show, Mojo!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_A_END_1,"Oh, don't worry your little Cajun-fried head about that! We're just getting started! <size=90>HAHAHAHAHA!</size>"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_B_START_0,"Time to get <size=90>ROYAL</size> in the arena! All the way from Wakanda, it's the one... the only... Panther Noir!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_B_START_1,"One royal to another, how do you keep your adorin' fans from gettin' outta control?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_B_START_2,"In Wakanda, everyone is treated with respect. No need to keep anyone under control."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_B_END_0,"Hey, I won. Does that mean I'm the new Black Panther?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_B_END_1,Gambit wins again! Somehow...
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_C_START_0,"This time, it's back to the streets for a good ol' fashion STREET FIGHT!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_C_START_1,I do miss a good street fight. No rules. No bounds.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_C_START_2,"Oh but this won't be a street fight, it'll be a street slaughter."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_C_END_0,"Mojo, I thought you wanted a show? I'm getting as bored as the audience here."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB1_C_END_1,Just stay tuned <size=90>EVERYBODY</size> the fun is just getting started.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_0,That Cajun wannabe would still be in the swamps if it wasn't for me! Hm?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_1,"We're back? <size=90>WHAT?!</size> W-w-welcome back to Multiverse Mayhem! "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_2,"For the next <size=90>TWO</size> weeks, tune in to get your fill of everything <size=90>GAMBIT</size>!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_3,"Somewhere out there is a VERY jealous Deadpool... "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_4,"Tell us, Gambit -- how has this trip down memory lane been for you?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_5,"Dis is my life, eh? I gotta say, whatever you're throwin' at me, the real ting was tougher. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_INTRO_6,"Oh, is THAT SO?! Well, maybe these <size=90>NEXT</size> opponents won't be so easy!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_A_START_0,Mon ami! Dis reminds me of the Danger Room.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_A_START_1,Reminds me of all the times you ended up getting knocked on your butt in there!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M4_B_END_0,"Last time I got to <size=90>THAT</size> universe for my combatants... Uh, I mean CONTESTANTS! Contestants!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_A_START_0,Send in the next wave already! What am I paying you lazy lot for?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_A_START_1,"Mojo, anybody ever tell you dat patience is a virtue?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_A_START_2,Patience?! In today's modern push-button Mojo World?! Not a chance!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_B_START_0,"No need to turn green with envy, chere. Dere's plenty of Gambit to go around."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_B_START_1,Ew! Objection!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_C_START_0,Round of applause for all of our brave fighters! But the shows not over yet! Bring in the <size=90>NEXT</size> contestants!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_C_START_1,"These people want a piece of Gambit, eh? Who knew someone dis charming could have so many enemies. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M6_C_END_0,Gambit's bored. I'll be in my dressin' room if you need me.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_INTRO_0,Cards! Explosions! Damsels not in distress! Welcome back to <size=90>GAMBIT WEEK</size> here at Mojovision!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_INTRO_1,This episode is going to be a <size=90>DOOZY</size> for ol' Remy here!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_INTRO_2,"Friends call me Remy, Mojo. You get to call me Gambit. 			"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_INTRO_3,Ooooh! Spicy! You're going to need that Cajun fire if you're going to survive this round!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_A_START_0,"Making her grand appearance, all the way from across time and space! I give you... <size=90>THE PHOENIX</size>."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_A_START_1,"Me versus the Phoenix?! Mojo, that's low. Even for you!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_A_START_2,I never said I would make these fights fair! Now be a good lapdog and try to last more than a minute.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_B_START_0,"Okay, folks! Mojo Vision is PROUD to present... for your viewing pleasure... the Cosmic Chrome Dome... Galactic Messiah, himself..."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_B_START_1,THE SILVER SURFER!!!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_B_START_2,I need not the power cosmic to defeat the likes of you.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_B_END_0,"Turns out you mighta needed a little bit of the power cosmic, mon ami."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_C_START_0,Stay tuned after this match for an <size=90>EXCLUSIVE</size> preformance from the SPIDER SLAYERS!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_C_START_1,"Hey gramps, we'll take it easy on ya. Don't want you to break a hip."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_C_START_2,"Oh, dis is gonna be fun."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB2_C_END_0,"Back to band camp with ya, leave the stage for the adults."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_INTRO_0,Wow. Oh boy. Wasn't that a <size=90>GREAT</size> battle? Who knew the Cajun maestro still had it in him? <size=50>I didn't</size>.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_INTRO_1,Keep tuning in to <size=90>JOIN</size> us on a fight through memory lane!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_INTRO_2,We're entering the final stages of all things Gambit!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_INTRO_3,"But now, let's look to his <size=90>FUTURE</size>."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_INTRO_4,"And remember Gambit, lose any of these battles and you're <size=90>MINE FOREVER</size>."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_A_START_0,"Sorry chere, but I can't afford to lose."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_A_START_1,We were paid and brought here to ensure your loss.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_A_END_0,Hope Mojo didn't pay in advance.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_B_START_0,"Such a weak little play-thing you've given me, Mojo. I'll make quick work of him."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_B_START_1,Aren't you tired of being a tool?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_B_END_0,"Don't worry chere, I'm sure Rocket has a screwdriver around here somewhere to put you back together with."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_C_START_0,"Emma, as beautiful as ever, chere. Whatsay instead of a fight we kick back and play a hand of cards instead?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_C_START_1,"Even a mind-reader wouldn't trust you to deal, Le Beau."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M7_C_END_0,"Tsk, I always play fair. At least that's what I tell people."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_A_START_0,You think you can stand against me?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_A_START_1,Get down here and I'll show you why they call me the Ragin' Cajun.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_A_START_2,"Mojo, you sure went through a LOT of trouble to keep me here."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_A_START_3,Too bad it ain't gonna work.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_B_END_0,I was dis close to being impressed!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_C_START_0,Gambit. Your spirit is just as weak as I remembered. You'll fall as the X-Men did before you!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_M9_C_START_1,It's gonna take more than a dime-store Cable to stop me.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_INTRO_0,"How much more of dis we gonna do, Mojo? I'm getting home one way or another. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_INTRO_1,"But Gambit, you <size=90>ARE</size> home. The audience <size=90>LOVES</size> you (for some reason). "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_INTRO_2,"You're lucky! A lot of other people would <size=90>KILL</size> to be made a star by me! Or at least GET killed. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_INTRO_3,"Now, dance for the camera, puppet! HAHAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_A_START_0,"Out of all the dimensions we could have been taken to, why did it have to be Mojo's?"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_A_START_1,"We'll be free soon, my love. Remember, we defeat this petty human and we'll be free."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_B_START_0,This is the fight before the BIG FINALE! Let's see some pizzaz! One of those light shows that you're so famous for!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_B_START_1,"I got a lot more than a light show for you, Mojo!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_B_START_2,"I wasn't talking to you, imbecile! Them!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_B_END_0,These ratings are the best yet! Time for the real SHOWSTOPPER!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_C_START_0,Sinister? How did Mojo get you on the show?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_C_START_1,"Not much, just some of you and your southern belle's DNA. I'm absolutely tingling with anticipation of the possibilities!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_MB3_C_START_2,"Wasn't sure how you could get much creepier, Sinister. Time to wipe that smile off your face!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_0,"Alright Mojo! We're done! I've played all your games, now send me back to the X-Mansion."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_1,"Not so fast, Frenchie! There is <size=90>ONE</size> fight left! One you will NOT win. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_2,You've been QUITE the asset! Turns out talent from all across the multiverse want to come and beat the tar outta you.
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_3,"Except I beat alla them. Anyone else is gonna be the same story. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_4,You asked for it. <size=90>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!</size> for your viewing pleasure... I give you... the piece de resistance...
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_5,"The Cajun prince himself, <size=90>GAAAAAAAMBITTTTTT!!!</size>"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_6,What?! What second rate clone is dis?
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_7,"This ain't no clone, baby! This is YOU, from another dimension! Enjoy! HAHAHAHAHA!"
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_INTRO_8,Do you have what it takes to take yourself on? May the best Gambit win!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_START_0,"Mon ami, I AM the best Gambit."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_START_1,"Hah, I'll tell Rogue you said bonjour."
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_END_0,"I've paid my debt. I am a free man and there's nothing you can do to stop me. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_END_1,W-w-wait! I... I'll pay whatever you want! Points on the back end! I haven't had ratings this good since Multiverse Mayhem!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_END_2,"Forget it, Mojo. You can't afford me. "
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_END_3,You'll come crawling back! They ALWAYS come back! I'm the only one who can help you achieve what you're meant to be! A STAR!
ID_DIALOG_GAMBIT_RAID_BOSS_END_4,"Sorry, Mojo. The only thing I'm meant to be is an X-Men. "
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_INTRO_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_INTRO_1,I'm tellin' ya that doesn't make sense.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_INTRO_3,"There's no such person, and Grootmas doesn't exist!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_INTRO_4,"Can it, you two. We've got incoming."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_START_0,"Ravager scum, you'll pay for what you've done!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_START_1,"Ravager? Get your eyes checked, chump. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_END_0,"Well, that was fun."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_END_1,"It was not fun, Quill."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_01_END_2,"Uh, guys, I'm seeing a lot more ships here. Like a lot more."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_INTRO_0,"Team One is down. Team Two, move to intercept."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_INTRO_1,We are very popular!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_INTRO_2,Quill!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_INTRO_3,It's not me this time!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_END_0,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_END_1,"No, I don't think they want to whistle a ""Grootmas Jingle""."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_02_END_2,I... am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_03_START_0,"So-called Guardians of the Galaxy, you stand accused of collaboration and affiliation with the criminal Ravagers and their new leader."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_03_START_1,Back for a rematch? Let's dance!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_03_END_0,"I don't like this, Quill. Ravagers taking on the Kree and making them mad enough to come after us?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_03_END_1,We ain't gonna be welcome many places if word gets around that these chumps are on our heels.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_03_END_2,"Yeah, let's grab a computer core from one of the Kree ships and see what's going on."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_START_0,We're being boarded! To arms!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_MID_0,"Rocket, now would be a great time to look through the computer!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_MID_1,"Yeah, yeah, keep your shirt on!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_END_0,"Okay, looks like the Kree are tracking Ravager activity all over the galaxy."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_END_1,Hard to make sense of it but looks like some of your old pals are only a few jumps away.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_04_END_2,Looks like we know where we're going next.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_0,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_1,"Yeah, I can see that. But WHY did we jump HERE?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_2,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_3,"Wait, what do you mean Santa? How do you know about Santa?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_4,"Uh, Quill, you might want to look over there."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_5,"I have come to test your resolve, Guardians."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_INTRO_6,You're not Santa.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_END_0,We have passed this test with outstanding results!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_END_1,"So you have. By working together, you rise above your own limitations."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_END_2,Remember the bonds you share and draw strength from them. You will need that strength soon.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_END_3,"What? I'm so confused. Annnnnd he's gone. Great, super, swell. Rocket..."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_05_END_4,"Yeah, yeah, let's get outta here."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_START_0,Guardians? They've come to steal all our Grootmas presents!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_START_1,"Wait, what? Seriously?!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_END_0,"So let me get this straight, Grootmas is real?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_END_2,"Uh huh, uh huh. But why presents?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_06_END_3,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_START_0,"Rocket, do you think now is really the time for this? Nobody cares about Grootmas!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_START_1,I wish to know more about Grootmas!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_START_2,I enjoy presents.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_START_3,Not helping!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_MID_0,"Oh man, these guys have tons of loot. I'm going to have so many shoe stuffers!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_MID_1,Little gifts go in stockings!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_MID_2,"Pfft, what do you know. Earth doesn't even have Grootmas."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_07_END_0,"Ho ho! Jackpot. The nav computer has locations for all Ravager ships, including the flagship."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_INTRO_0,Groot?!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_INTRO_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_INTRO_2,How did you escape? Get him!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_INTRO_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_END_0,I think I found where the leader's at. We're close.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_08_END_1,Finally.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_INTRO_0,Gamora?! YOU'RE the Ravager's new leader?
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_INTRO_1,And is that... another Groot?
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_INTRO_2,You should have stayed away. Now it's DOUBLE GROOTMAS time.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_START_0,TIP: DEFEAT GAMORA.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_MID_0,Something's wrong. You're not Gamora.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_MID_1,"Not YOUR Gamora, weakling. I am a Conqueror of the Cosmos! The Queen of the Ravagers!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_MID_2,"And after Double Grootmas, I'll be the queen of these ones too."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_0,"Wow, two Groots?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_1,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_3,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_4,I AM GROOT!!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_5,I am Drax.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_6,I am Mantis.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_09_END_7,I am... so confused.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_START_0,"So wait, did we just... steal Grootmas?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_START_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_START_2,Let's just get back to the ship before the rest of the crew catches up with us.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_START_3,TIP: PROTECT FESTIVE GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_MID_0,"So long, chumps!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_MID_1,"Damn you, Guardians!\nYou done stole Grootmas!"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_FAIL_0,"FESTIVE GROOT WAS DEFEATED! MISSION FAILED. "
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_0,Am I the only one who thinks that was really weird and wants to know what the hell just happened?
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_1,"What was up with Warlock ""testing"" us? Who was that Gamora? Why do Grootmas gifts go in shoes?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_3,"Oh, really?"
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_4,I am... Groot.
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_5,"Oh, well I guess it makes sense then."
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_6,I am glad we have solved every mystery and no questions are left not answered!
ID_DIALOG_GUARDIANSGROOTMAS_10_END_7,It is a Grootmas miracle!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_INTRO_0,"Hey, Commander! Groot's gone missing. I'm rounding up a search party. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_INTRO_1,I need to grab some S.T.R.I.K.E. guys for backup. Thanks.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_INTRO_2,"Last place he was seen was some backwater Ravager planet. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_INTRO_3,I'm going to start there by roughing up some of the locals.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_END_0,"Hey, Ravager! WHERE'S GROOT?"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_END_1,Your tree friend passed through here a while ago. Sounded like he was trying to make himself scarce. And fast.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_END_2,Then some crazy robot charged in and took off with him.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_01_END_3,Ultron? What does Ultron want with Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_0,"OK, bucket of bolts. Hand over my friend, and no one gets their spark plugs pulled."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_1,"Your alien friend developed a rare fungus I plan on augmenting to my needs. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_2,"Fungus? Your wiring's messed up, Toaster Head. Groot's NOT sick."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_3,Negative. The fungus is highly contagious. It is why he went into seclusion.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_4,"If Groot's sick, we've got to help him. Hand him over."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_5,Your threats are inconsequential. I tire of them.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_INTRO_6,Fine then. Disassembly time.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_END_0,Where are you holding Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_END_1,"He is guarded by an army of my drones. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_END_2,You will never reach him.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_02_END_3,We'll see about that.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_0,What's this you say about Groot being sick?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_1,"The tree alien was hiding because he did not want to contaminate anyone. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_2,I intend to mutate the fungus to destroy humanity.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_3,"Not a fan of ANY of that! "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_4,Now where is he?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_5,Guarded by my Ultron army. There is no way to save him.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_INTRO_6,I'm getting Groot. Even if I have to disassemble every single one of your tin can soldiers.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_0,"Groot, how could you just skip out like that? We're family!"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_1,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_2,"I know you're sick, but we'll find a cure. Don't worry!"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_3,"Rocket Raccoon, back away from Groot. The Kree cannot risk an outbreak. Groot must be eliminated."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_4,"Oh great, now you bozos had to show up and complicate things."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_03_END_5,"How about YOU back away, or I'll give you something to regret. I'm not abandoning Groot."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_INTRO_0,"Step away from the infected alien. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_INTRO_1,He must be exterminated for the safety of the galaxy.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_INTRO_2,The infection cannot be allowed to spread.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_INTRO_3,I'm gonna rip out those cybernetics and build a coffee maker out of them!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_FAIL_0,They took out Groot! No...
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_0,"Well, they're down for the count. I think I've got an idea on where we can find you a cure."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_2,"It's risky, but that might work. I like it! I'll send a message and--"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_3,"This rotting tree has been judged as a threat to the Kree Empire. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_4,"Prepare for execution. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_04_END_5,"Take a number, pal. I got plenty of bullets. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_INTRO_0,"Korath may have fallen for your tricks, but I will not."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_INTRO_1,The Kree Empire has judged Groot's infection as an intergalactic threat.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_INTRO_2,Not gonna happen. You gotta fight through us just like everybody else if you want a piece of him!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_INTRO_3,I AM GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_FAIL_0,Groot's down!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_END_0,"You fools, this tree's infection puts billions of lives at risk."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_END_1,We'll find a cure. I'm not giving up on him.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_END_2,We will stop you. It's only a matter of time.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_END_3,I am Groot...
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_05_END_4,No. He's NOT right. We'll find another way.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_INTRO_0,The Kree sent me to exterminate Groot before his fungus spreads.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_INTRO_1,You didn't get the message? YOU'RE NOT KILLING GROOT!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_INTRO_2,"Sorry, Raccoon. This is not personal."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_FAIL_0,"Ah crap, Groot's down!"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_END_0,"That seems to be the last of Team ""Exterminate Groot."""
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_END_1,Now we can work on finding a cure.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_END_2,Especially considering I'm probably infected now.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_06_END_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_INTRO_0,"This is A.I.M.'s formal requisition of the contaminated lifeform to study... "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_INTRO_1," ...with the intent of weaponizing the fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_FAIL_0,"Groot, no!!!"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_END_0,"Commander, A.I.M. took Groot!"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_END_1,They're going to experiment on him to weaponize the fungus.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_07_END_2,They. Are. Going. To. Pay.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_0,"Hand over Groot, techno-geek."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_1,"This disease is magnificent. Once we weaponize it, it will make A.I.M. billions."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_2,So that's a no?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_3,Affirmative.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_4,Wait. Now I'm confused. You ARE going to hand him over?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_INTRO_5,"Screw it. I'm just going to shoot you. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_END_0,"Groot, did they hurt you?"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_END_1,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_08_END_2,"I mean, except for the fact that you still have an infectious, life-threatening fungus."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_0,"Hey Groot, I just accessed A.I.M.'s medical database."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_1,Seems like when they tried to weaponize this disease you got...
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_2,...they also developed a cure as a fail-safe.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_3,What do you say we blast our way to the lab and steal the cure?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_4,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_INTRO_5,"Forty-two, actually. Why do you ask?"
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_END_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_09_END_1,"I guess we'll find out. Hopefully not too bad. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_INTRO_0,"Just hand over the vaccine, and we'll be on our way."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_INTRO_1,"A.I.M. will profit greatly from the weaponization of this infection. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_INTRO_2,"Not if it means experimenting on my friend. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_INTRO_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_INTRO_4,"I agree, Groot. Time for a different approach."
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_0,"OK, buddy. Looks like the antidote is working. "
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_1,You feel anything yet?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_2,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_3,Oh yeah... I'm gettin' dizzy... This stuff really works!
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_4,We better sleep this one off.
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_5,I'm sure everything will be fine by the morn--
ID_DIALOG_ROCKETRACCOON_EVENT_10_END_6,I... am... Groot...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_INTRO_0,"Team, get your kit and get to the jet. We've got reports of another interdimensional rift."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_INTRO_1,The brain boys say it's the same frequency as the one our latest recruit came out of; might be one of his team.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_INTRO_2,"But also might not, he was in the middle of a huge battle. Wheels up in 5!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_START_0,"This is Union Jack, a member of the Invaders from another reality."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_START_1,Union Jack is great at controlling enemy speed and debuffing enemies to shut them down.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_START_2,"Pay attention to his charge mechanic linked to bullets in his gun. Counting bullets matters, but reloading grants helpful bonuses as well."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE2_0,"Wow, what a rush! Who are you gents, then? Hydra? Jerries? Both?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE2_1,Security to the Lab! Someone came out of the rift!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE2_2,Yanks? What the bloody hell? Where am I?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE3_0,"Halt, intruder!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE3_1,Sure are a lot of these yanks.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE3_2,Hold fast! Cavalry's here!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_WAVE3_3,"Music to my ears, love."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_END_0,"The shield n' outfit gets you 2 minutes, love. Then I start shooting."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_END_1,"Stand down, Falsworth. You're among friends."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_END_2,"Rogers? Bloody hell, what's going on?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_01_END_3,Captain Carter here will explain. Just listen.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_START_0,"Other worlds, other times. Wild. If that's all true, I only have one question."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_START_1,And what's that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_START_2,"How come these two Rogers' are Captain America, but you go through the same thing and you're not Captain England?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_END_0,"You get pulled through an interdimensional rift into another universe, and that's the only question you have? My code name?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_END_1,"If Rogers says this is all on the up and up, I have no reason to doubt. But we're both wearing the flag and you use your actual name."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_END_2,"It's just odd, is all."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_02_END_3,"Mr. Falsworth, I think we're going to get along swimmingly."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_START_0,So what's the deal with these blokes in yellow? This place seems pretty high tech.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_START_1,"They're a terrorist group called Advanced Idea Mechanics-- or A.I.M. Mad science, overthrow the world order. That kind of thing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_START_2,Sounds like some other group of gents Rogers and I know.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_END_0,"Rogers, did you pop out in a place like this?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_END_1,"No, the 'rift' I came out of was basically in the middle of nowhere. It was a running fight all the way to the plane."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_END_2,Then why did I fall out here?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_END_3,Good question. A.I.M. somehow stabilized a rift in their lab. Maybe we should start asking these gentlemen how they managed that.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_03_END_4,"Lady, I like your style."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_START_0,The intruders are headed for command level. Release the prisoners!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_START_1,Prisoners?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_START_2,You smell... like rift!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_0,What the bloody hell was that?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_1,We're not the only people trapped in this world. And most of them used to be mind controlled by some kinda alien warlord.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_2,This just keeps gettin' better and better don't it?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_3,"I checked the computers, there's a command level a few floors down. If there's a leader, that's where they'll be."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_4,How many more variants between us and that level?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_04_END_5,Enough.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_START_0,"I see now why my forces were so easily dispatched. Five super soldiers, a symbiote, and whatever you are. Quite the motley crew."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_START_1,But you're not the only super soldiers. Ultimus left so much fascinating tech behind after he was defeated.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_START_2,Surely you've heard of Superconductive Dimensional Energy? it powered Ultimus' ship as it traveled the multiverse.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_START_3,"It powers this very facility, where I harness the powers of reality itself! And now... it powers... ME!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_MID_0,She's siphoning power from that device. We've got to destroy it.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_END_0,"What a strange day. Is this what your world is like, Carter? High stakes danger, incredible adventure, life and death battles?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_END_1,"What, this? This is nothing, Mr. Falsworth. For me this is just another Tuesday."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_END_2,"Well, color me impressed. And the name is Jack. Union Jack."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_UJ_05_END_3,"Nice to meet you, Union Jack. Glad to have you aboard."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_INTRO_0,"We've got another hit on the scanner, boys. Same frequency as you and your team, Steve."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_INTRO_1,Must be Orson. We'd better get a move on. Where's he showing up.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_INTRO_2,Just a little town on the coast you might have heard of.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_START_0,"This is Iron Fist (WWII), a member of the Invaders from another reality."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_START_1,He is good at XYZ.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_START_2,[1-2 Sentences about how to play IF WWII]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_0,"[What the hell was that flash of light? This isn't France. Looks like New York. Smells like it, too.]"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_1,"Foolish trespasser. I don't know how you evaded our lookouts, but soon it won't matter. Hand, attack!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_2,[Hand? Hmph. Some things never change.]
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE2_3,You can't even imagine the mistake you just made.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_0,So it WAS a traveler I sensed.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_1,Something's not right. Look at that glow. He has the Fist.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_2,"Who are you, stranger?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE3_3,"The name's Orson Randall, but my enemies call me... IRON FIST!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_0,"Orson, duck!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_1,"Cap? "
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_2,"Hey, what am I, chopped liver?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_WAVE4_3,"Talk later, gents. It's fightin' time!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_END_0,"Cap, you want to clue me in on what's going on here?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_01_END_1,"Orson, let me introduce you to Captain Carter. Trust me, we've got a lot to catch up on."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_INTRO_0,And that's about it. Any questions?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_INTRO_1,"Your story sounds like bull, Lady. But I trust my eyes, I trust Cap, and that imposter DID have the Fist."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_INTRO_2,Even if I barely broke a sweat. Guess K'un-Lun's getting lax on discipline in the future.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_START_0,"Enemies located! Hand, to me!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_END_0,Hmph. Looks like the city's got a garbage problem.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_END_1,"Before we leave and meet your Commander, let's take out the trash."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_02_END_2,"You know, a little workout might be just the thing."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_START_0,"The master was right; we have rift travelers. But you aren't the only visitors, strangers."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_START_1,The master has gifted us a bounty from worlds beyond!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_START_2,That's a lot of ninjas.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_MID_0,I'll take the ugly one.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_MID_1,Which one's the ugly one?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_END_0,Useless creatures!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_END_1,Shall we go after him?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_03_END_2,Give him a bit of a head start. He'll draw more of his guys out of the shadows. Less work to hunt 'em down later.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_START_0,"Fools, you face the full fury of the Hand!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_START_1,10 of them for every one of us? Hardly seems fair... for them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_MID_0,It looks like you fellas could use a hand with these Hand.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_MID_1,Who is that guy and why does it smell like rain all of a sudden?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_END_0,"Not as fun as fighting Nazis, but it helps me remember what it's like to feel something."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_END_1,Thanks for the assist... Spider-Man?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_END_2,"No trouble, ma'am."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_END_3,This world is bizarre.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_04_END_4,"Randall, you don't even know the half of it."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_INTRO_0,It looks like the gang's all here. And Captain Carter for a bonus.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_INTRO_1,Wong? No... you're not our Wong.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_INTRO_2,"No, I'm not. My reality was destroyed. And soon enough, yours will be too. They're too powerful to stop."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_INTRO_3,I'm really getting tired of this pronoun game. Tell me who you work for!
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_INTRO_4,Make me.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_START_0,Been awhile since I fought someone from Kamar-Taj.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_START_1,"And yet, I destroyed a K'un-Lun last week. What a coincidence."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_START_2,"Oh yeah? Double or nothing, Sorcerer!"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_0,"Now are you going to tell me who you work for, or do I have to take Mr. Randall here off the leash?"
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_1,*cough*
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_2,I was ordered by... Killmonger... of the Aphelions. But even he... serves a darker master...
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_3,You can't win... nobody can stop them.
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_4,Killmonger? Could that be the king those Wakandans were referencing?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_5,He's tried to seize the throne in our world several times. Maybe in his he succeeded?
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_6,"Whatever all that means, it sounds like a solid lead. Maybe it's time we met your C.O., Peggy."
ID_DIALOG_SCE_IFWW2_05_END_7,"Right you are, Steve. And I'm sure Director Fury can't wait to meet all of you as well."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_0,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_1,I am Cosmo!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_2,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_3,"Yes, new friend Groot... I am Cosmo?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_4,"Hey, fleabag, you speak Groot?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_5,"No, but I am trying to learn! I am trying to get Groot to tell me all about your adventures!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_6,"He doesn't say anything else! How could you miss that? Sigh... Okay, listen up. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_INTRO_7,The first thing about us is that we used to... Ya know... Steal things. A lot!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_START_0,The alarm sounds! Destroy the thieves before they escape!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_START_1,Drax! I told you to disable the alarm!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_START_2,"I did disable it. Right before the very loud noise started, I ripped it from the wall! Many wires dangled. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_START_3,"Okay, new plan! We focus on the 'smash' part of smash and grab!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_END_0,"Quill's plan went sideways as usual, but thanks to some last-minute heroics from ME, we were saved."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_END_1,Wow! What did you do?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_01_END_2,"Oh, I blew the Kree ship up.\nREAL good. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_INTRO_0,What was the thing that you blew up a whole ship to steal? It must have been very valuable!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_INTRO_1,"Who knows! We stole so much stuff from so many flarkin' dinguses back then that I lost count. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_INTRO_2,"The only problem with stealing things is that usually, someone else wants to steal them, too..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_START_0,"Okay, Quill! You mighta beat us to the goods, but you ain't free and clear yet. Hand it over. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_START_1,"If it were just me, I'd surrender, Yondu! Since I'm such a big coward. But Rocket's going to save me again!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_START_2,"Wow, did Star-Lord really say that?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_START_3,"You callin' me a liar? Now, listen up to the rest..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_0,"I saved the day YET AGAIN, and afterward, they made me king of the Ravagers. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_1,Wow! Truly amazing!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_2,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_3,I am NOT embellishing! I don't even know what embellishing is!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_4,"...I am Groot. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_5,"Okay, okay... Maybe that wasn't EXACTLY how it went down. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_02_END_6,"But what happened next when the Kree showed up again... That's totally the truth. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_INTRO_0,"So, maybe I didn't so much beat ALL the Ravagers."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_INTRO_1,But we did at least stall long enough for the Kree to catch up to us.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_INTRO_2,"Wait, isn't that a bad thing?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_INTRO_3,"Psh, yeah, with that attitude!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_INTRO_4,"I, on the other hand, saw this as a chance to test out a brand new beautiful blaster..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_START_0,HAHAHAHAHA! BLAM! DEAD! BLAM! AH HAHAHA!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_START_1,Rocket! Watch where you're firing that thing!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_START_2,I am watching! You think I'd miss this?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_START_3,You better miss ME or I'll shave you in your sleep... AGAIN!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_END_0,"We finally made enough of a mess that the Kree and Ravagers ended up fighting each other. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_END_1,And did you sell the stolen goods for wonderous riches?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_03_END_2,"Flarkin' right, we did! At least, I think we did? We must have..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_0,I don't understand why you and the Guardians stopped stealing things if you miss it so much.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_1,Hey... That's a good point. Why DID we stop?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_2,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_3,To do the right thing'?!\nThat CAN'T be it.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_4,"We did end up doing some heroics that time we got mixed up with a stuck-up golden jerk. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_5,You mean Adam Warlock!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_INTRO_6,"Oh, so you hate him, too?\nAnyway, it started with a simple misunderstanding..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_START_0,"Rocket, what did you say to make these guys so mad?!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_START_1,I think it wasn't WHAT I said so much. It was more HOW I said it...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_START_2,How did you say it?!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_START_3,"Heh heh, I'll tell you later. But you're not gonna like it either!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_END_0,I thought this was a story of your heroism? And yet... This is mostly a tale of your rudeness.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_END_1,I'm gettin' to the hero part!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_END_2,Warlock was about to face the biggest bad in the galaxy. And his poorly dressed clowns were gonna need our help.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_END_3,I am Groot.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_04_END_4,"No, I DON'T think their outfits were cool! You don't even wear clothes!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_0,"Warlock was about to go up against someone even scarier than a Terran with all their pink skin showing. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_1,"The biggest bad in the galaxy, who'd brung his whole flarkin' Black Order with him. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_2,Thanos!!!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_3,*BARK! BARK! BARK!*
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_4,"Hey! Knock it off! "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_INTRO_5,"Sorry... I am simply very excited. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_START_0,Adam Warlock... You attempt to stand against me. Now you and your minions will be destroyed.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_START_1,"Woah! We are NOT his minions. We, like, JUST met this guy. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_START_2,"Is this really the time for clarification, Peter Quill?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_START_3,"I just think it's important to understand who everyone is before he destroys us, is all."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_0,"Incredible! By banding together, you were able to defeat one of the most powerful threats in the universe!"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_1,"Yeah, we beat him with the power of friendship. Or maybe Drax's knives. I forget which."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_2,"And now storytime is done, and I need Groot back so we can, uh, do more good deeds."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_3,I am Groot?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_4,Wait! Is that the ship's proximity alarm?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_05_END_5,Uh oh...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_0,"Rocket! You don't know anything about the evil versions of us from another universe about to board our ship, do you?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_1,You're gonna need to be more specific. WHICH evil versions of us?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_2,The ones looking for the Primagen Crystals we stole from the Kree like... forever ago.
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_3,"But we don't have those crystals, right? Because you SOLD them when we told you to, RIGHT?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_4,I wasn't just going to sell them! You know how many Kree and Ravagers I had to explode to get these?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_INTRO_5,Yes! Because I was THERE!
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_START_0,"Okay, uglies! Give us the crystals and we'll blow you up once instead of a buncha times. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_START_1,"Hey, Cosmo! Want to be a part of one of those stories?"
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_START_2,Grrrr...
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_0,"And that is how we beat an evil version of the Guardians. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_1,"Yes... this time I was there as well. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_2,"My storytelling was so vivid. I made it feel as though it happened only yesterday. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_3,"It just happened.\nLike two minutes ago. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_4,Does this mean I am a member of your team now?
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_5,"Yeah, sure, welcome aboard. Now, as your first official bit of Guardians business..."
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_6,"Help me and Groot figure out where I left those highly volatile crystals before they blow up and kill us all. "
ID_DIALOG_ECM_GOTGVOL3_06_END_7,I am Groot!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_01_INTRO_0,"Ugh... "
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_01_INTRO_1,It's never a good day when a portal opens up in your neighborhood and Doc Ock walks through it with glowing red eyes.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_02_INTRO_0,"Hey Miles, have you seen a cannister containing a black sentient ooze lying around here somewhere?"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_02_INTRO_1,What are you talking about?
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_02_INTRO_2,"Wait, you mean the symbiote?! You misplaced the symbiote sample?!"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_02_INTRO_3,Guys. I think I've found it... er them.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_03_INTRO_0,"I can't believe the symbiotes are actually going to help me with this one. "
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_03_INTRO_1,They can be a great help... as long as I don't have to get near any of them.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_04_INTRO_0,"You are coming with me, Spider-Man. You are the necessary ingredient for my experimental Spider-Hex spell."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_04_INTRO_1,No way! I'm not going to help you with that!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_04_INTRO_2,"I am afraid he is correct, Agatha. He is not going with you. He's coming with ME! I need him for my own Spider-Incinerator experiment. "
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_04_INTRO_3,Wait. What?!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_05_INTRO_0,"You're in danger, Miles."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_05_INTRO_1,I'm from a future where portals open up all around the city and villains are hunting down Spider-Men and Spider-Women.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_SPIDERVERSE_05_INTRO_2,I think that's already happening.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_INTRO_0,"FISK TOWER, NEW YORK CITY..."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_INTRO_1,"We have Kingpin on the ropes. As soon as he shows his ugly mug, that's when we take him in."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_INTRO_2,"O.M.G., this is so exciting! Taking down THE Kingpin with THE Defenders!"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_INTRO_3,Look alive! Here he comes!
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_START_0,You people are a nuisance. I'll have to deal with you myself.
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_START_1,"We can do this the easy way or the hard way, Kingpin! ...I've always wanted to say that."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_START_2,"I think he prefers the hard way. Luckily, so do we."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_MID_0,"Kamala Khan! Come with me. Urgent S.T.R.I.K.E. business. "
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_MID_1,"Nick Fury?! I'll be right there, we need to finish beating up some bad guys first."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_END_0,"Woah, the real Nick Fury! I think? You're not a Skrull, are you...?"
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_END_1,"No, I'm not a damn Skrull. There's a cosmic threat that we're dealing with, and you're getting called in."
ID_DIALOG_EVENT_FL_MARVELS_01_END_2,Sounds fun! But why me?
