ID_DRAFT_RULES_BODY_STANDARD,"<color=#db8721><size=60>Draft</size></color>\n\nThe draft consists of three different phases. The players take alternating turns and have a limited time to make their selection(s) for each phase. If the timer expires during a player's turn, the game automatically selects the highest-powered character. If a character is highlighted when the player's timer expires, the highlighted character is selected.\n\n<color=#db8721><i>BAN</i></color>\nDuring the BAN phase, you view your opponent's roster. The character you choose here is globally unavailable during the PICK phase.\n\n<color=#db8721><i>PICK</i></color>\nDuring the PICK phase, you view your own roster. Choose a character to place into the active slot in your squad. Chosen characters are locked into the positions in which they were placed and are unavailable to your opponent.\n\n<color=#db8721><i>REJECT</i></color>\nDuring the REJECT phase, you choose a character to remove from your opponent's squad. A rejected character is globally unavailable during the PICK phase.\n\n<color=#db8721><size=60>Combat</size></color>\n\n<color=#db8721><i>TURN TIMER</i></color>\nThe timer for each player's first turn is 75 seconds. Each subsequent turn is 10 seconds. Players must confirm their action before their turn timer expires. If the turn timer expires before a player is able to confirm an action, the auto AI makes a move for the character. If a player misses three actions, the player automatically forfeits the match and the battle ends.\n\n<color=#db8721><i>WIN CONDITION</i></color>\nEliminating all of the opponent's characters results in a victory. If the battle timer expires, the players have 8 moves to complete combat. Afterwards, if both players have surviving characters, the player with the most surviving characters is deemed the victor. If both players have an equal number of surviving characters, the player with the most damage dealt is deemed the victor. If both players have the same damage dealt, the player with the highest single attack damage is deemed the victor.\n\n"
