ID_AVA3D_INACTIVE_LANDING_POPUP_BODY,"<color=#db8721>GENERAL</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Alliances are automatically matched with another Alliance multiple times a week for a 24-hour War.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Use War Energy to battle defensive squads and score points. War Energy is regenerated during the duration of the War, and War Energy Refills can be used to refresh War Energy for additional attacks.\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color> At the start of War everyone begins with 4 War Energy, regardless of the amount one may have ended with from the previous War.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> When attacking, you do not need a full team of 5 characters. Select anywhere from 1 to 5 characters per attack.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Earn points for each defending character defeated by the end of a battle (summoned characters do not count as a point). Room Points are earned for destroying all defensive squads in a room.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Some rooms are worth more points than others, so focus your attacks wisely.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> The Alliance with the most points when time runs out wins the War. If the score is tied, the match will be a draw and both Alliances will receive the Defeat rewards. If both Alliances destroy each other's Helicarrier, whoever destroyed it first wins. Rewards are sent to your Inbox.\n\n<color=#86e619>5)</color> All players that participated in a War will receive either the Victory or Defeat rewards. Participation includes at least one attack or boost. You must be in an Alliance for a minimum of 5 days to receive a War's season rewards.\n\n<color=#86e619>6)</color> The points your Alliance earned in a War will be applied to the War Season Leaderboard. Winning Alliances will also get a Leaderboard Point Bonus, which is based on a percentage of the Alliance's Total Collection Power calculated at the end of the War.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Keep powering up your characters even if you don't use them to maximize your Leaderboard Point Bonus.\n\n<color=#86e619>7)</color> Powering up your roster during a War will impact your attacking characters, but not your defending characters (their improved Power will take effect in the next War).\n\n<color=#86e619>8)</color> If you leave an Alliance during a War, your defending characters will continue to defend the Helicarrier for the duration of that War.\n\n<color=#86e619>9)</color> When you join an Alliance, you will have a 24-hour cooldown until you can set defenses for the Helicarrier or participate in a War. You must be in the alliance before matchmaking begins in order to participate in the war.\n\n<color=#db8721>LEAGUES</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Leagues are a way for alliances to increase their rewards in War by climbing League Tiers.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Alliances earn and lose Trophies by winning and losing War matches. If the alliance earns or loses enough Trophies, the alliance will enter a new League Tier.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> The amount of Trophies that can be won or lost in a War match is dependent on the league your alliance is in and the league your opponent is in.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color> League Tiers are not factored in to matchmaking.\n\n<color=#db8721>SETTING UP DEFENSES</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> You can set up your Helicarrier defenses in between Wars (also known as Peacetime).\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Access your Alliance Helicarrier from the Alliance War screen.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Select an available room.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> Claim a slot. (You can only defend a single room.)\n\n<color=#86e619>5)</color>Edit your defensive squads.\n <color=#86e619>a)</color> You can set a total of 10 squads on Defense.\n <color=#86e619>b)</color> Unfilled squad slots will use default S.H.I.E.L.D. Guards, which are level 40, gear tier 4, with ability levels 3/3/1.\n <color=#86e619>c)</color> Squads can be a mix of characters from your roster and default S.H.I.E.L.D. Guards.\n <color=#86e619>d)</color> Characters set on defense CANNOT be used to attack.\n <color=#86e619>e)</color> The order in which squads are placed is the order in which they will appear to attackers.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Managing your roster is key to being successful in Alliance War. Think ahead to which characters you'd like to use for defense and which ones to use to attack.\n\n<color=#86e619>6)</color> Once you have set up your defenses, you are ready for War.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color> Rooms that are above, below, to the left, and to the right of a room are considered adjacent to that room. \n\n<color=#db8721>PARTICIPATING IN WAR</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Characters can only be used to attack once per War.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Stretch your roster further by bringing fewer than 5 characters into battle.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Each room has two slots that are defended by two players from the opposing Alliance. Select a room and choose a squad to attack. A total of four squads are visible at a time for the selected player (you can toggle which player's squads are shown), and they are displayed in the order in which they were placed.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Gain access to rooms below by defeating all the squads of one defending player. Defeat all the squads of both players to reveal rooms to the top, left, and right.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> Boosts can be applied to your defensive squads while viewing your defenses.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color>Primary Stats consist of Max Health, Damage, Armor, Resistance, and Focus.\n\n<color=#db8721>ISO-8 IN WAR</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Characters who have at least T1 L4 Iso-8 equipped will gain the WAR READY trait.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> While your Helicarrier's Hangar and/or Cargo Bay are active, characters with the WAR READY trait will gain bonuses to their Primary Stats while attacking (Hangar) or defending (Cargo Bay), respectively."

Your S.T.R.I.K.E Agents need Ability Materials to maximize their potential and there's no better place to get them than Alliance Raids.\n\nPlease review the alliance {alliance} and see if you'd like to join them.\n\n\n<i>If you want to opt out of receiving alliance recommendations, turn off 'Receive Alliance Recommendations' in Advanced Options.</i>"

ID_AVA3D_INACTIVE_LANDING_POPUP_SUBHEADER_KNOWHERE,<color=#CD97FF>Welcome to Alliance War: Knowhere Siege!</color>
ID_AVA3D_INACTIVE_LANDING_POPUP_BODY_KNOWHERE,"<color=#db8721>GENERAL</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Alliances are automatically matched with another Alliance multiple times a week for a 24-hour War.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Use War Energy to battle defensive squads and score points. War Energy Refills can be used to refresh War Energy for additional attacks.\n<color=#CD97FF>KNOWHERE SIEGE NOTE:</color> At the start of War everyone begins with 10 War Energy, regardless of the amount one may have ended with from the previous War. War Energy no longer regenerates over the duration of the war.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> When attacking, you do not need a full team of 5 characters. Select anywhere from 1 to 5 characters per attack.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Earn points for each defending character defeated by the end of a battle (summoned characters do not count as a point). Room Points are earned for destroying all defensive squads in a room.\n<color=#CD97FF>KNOWHERE SIEGE NOTE:</color> After each completed attack on a defensive squad, 1 <color=#fff568>Exhausted</color> will be applied to each defensive unit. <color=#fff568>Exhausted</color> reduces the character's Damage, Armor, Focus, Resistance, and Damage Reduction by 20% per <color=#fff568>Exhausted</color>, and can be stacked up to 4 times. Canceled combats will not add <color=#fff568>Exhausted</color>.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Some rooms are worth more points than others, so focus your attacks wisely.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> The Alliance with the most points when time runs out wins the War. If the score is tied, the match will be a draw and both Alliances will receive the Defeat rewards. Rewards are sent to your Inbox.\n<color=#CD97FF>KNOWHERE SIEGE NOTE:</color> Knowhere Siege introduces the Attempt Bonus. Clear squads in the fewest attempts possible to get the highest Attempt Bonus. Defeat a squad in one attack for an Attempt Bonus of 10. Two attacks on a squad will grant an Attempt Bonus of 8, and three or more attacks will grant an Attempt bonus of 6. Canceled combats will count against your Attempt Bonus.\n<color=#CD97FF>KNOWHERE SIEGE NOTE:</color> If both Alliances destroy each other's Helicarrier and are tied on Attempt Bonus points, whoever destroyed it first wins.\n\n<color=#86e619>5)</color> All players that participated in a War will receive either the Victory or Defeat rewards. Participation includes at least one attack or boost. You must be in an Alliance for a minimum of 5 days to receive a War's season rewards.\n\n<color=#86e619>6)</color> The points your Alliance earned in a War will be applied to the War Season Leaderboard. Winning Alliances will also get a Leaderboard Point Bonus, which is based on a percentage of the Alliance's Total Collection Power calculated at the end of the War.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Keep powering up your characters even if you don't use them to maximize your Leaderboard Point Bonus.\n\n<color=#86e619>7)</color> Powering up your roster during a War will impact your attacking characters, but not your defending characters (their improved Power will take effect in the next War).\n\n<color=#86e619>8)</color> If you leave an Alliance during a War, your defending characters will continue to defend the Helicarrier for the duration of that War.\n\n<color=#86e619>9)</color> When you join an Alliance, you will have a 24-hour cooldown until you can set defenses for the Helicarrier or participate in a War. You must be in the alliance before matchmaking begins in order to participate in the war.\n\n<color=#86e619>10)</color> During <color=#CD97FF>Knowhere Siege</color>, there will be shared room bonuses that get applied in each and every room. These bonuses are as follows:\n\n<color=#CD97FF>[ROOM]</color>    <color=#86e619>+100%</color> Primary Stats to <color=#fff568>DEFENDING Thanos and Black Order ALLIES</color>. If not <color=#fff568>Exhausted</color>, apply <color=#fff568>3 Safeguard, Evade, Offense Up, and Speed Up</color>.\n<color=#CD97FF>[ROOM]</color>    <color=#86e619>+10%</color> Primary Stats to War Ready <color=#fff568>ATTACKING ALLIES</color>. \n Extra <color=#86e619>+10%</color> to <color=#fff568> War Ready ATTACKING Knowhere ALLIES</color>.\n\n<color=#db8721>LEAGUES</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Leagues are a way for alliances to increase their rewards in War by climbing League Tiers.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Alliances earn and lose Trophies by winning and losing War matches. If the alliance earns or loses enough Trophies, the alliance will enter a new League Tier.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> The amount of Trophies that can be won or lost in a War match is dependent on the league your alliance is in and the league your opponent is in.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color> League Tiers are not factored in to matchmaking.\n\n<color=#db8721>SETTING UP DEFENSES</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> You can set up your Helicarrier defenses in between Wars (also known as Peacetime).\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Access your Alliance Helicarrier from the Alliance War screen.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Select an available room.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> Claim a slot. (You can only defend a single room.)\n\n<color=#86e619>5)</color>Edit your defensive squads.\n <color=#86e619>a)</color> You can set a total of 10 squads on Defense.\n <color=#86e619>b)</color> Unfilled squad slots will use default S.H.I.E.L.D. Guards, which are level 40, gear tier 4, with ability levels 3/3/1.\n <color=#86e619>c)</color> Squads can be a mix of characters from your roster and default S.H.I.E.L.D. Guards.\n <color=#86e619>d)</color> Characters set on defense CANNOT be used to attack.\n <color=#86e619>e)</color> The order in which squads are placed is the order in which they will appear to attackers.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Managing your roster is key to being successful in Alliance War. Think ahead to which characters you'd like to use for defense and which ones to use to attack.\n\n<color=#86e619>6)</color> Once you have set up your defenses, you are ready for War.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color> Rooms that are above, below, to the left, and to the right of a room are considered adjacent to that room. \n\n<color=#db8721>PARTICIPATING IN WAR</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Characters can only be used to attack once per War.\n<color=#fff568>TIP:</color> Stretch your roster further by bringing fewer than 5 characters into battle.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> Each room has two slots that are defended by two players from the opposing Alliance. Select a room and choose a squad to attack. A total of four squads are visible at a time for the selected player (you can toggle which player's squads are shown), and they are displayed in the order in which they were placed.\n\n<color=#86e619>3)</color> Gain access to rooms below by defeating all the squads of one defending player. Defeat all the squads of both players to reveal rooms to the top, left, and right.\n\n<color=#86e619>4)</color> Boosts can be applied to your defensive squads while viewing your defenses.\n\n<color=#fff568>NOTE:</color>Primary Stats consist of Max Health, Damage, Armor, Resistance, and Focus.\n\n<color=#db8721>ISO-8 IN WAR</color>\n\n<color=#86e619>1)</color> Characters who have at least T1 L4 Iso-8 equipped will gain the WAR READY trait.\n\n<color=#86e619>2)</color> While certain rooms in your Helicarrier are active, characters with the WAR READY trait will gain bonuses to their Primary Stats on defense.\n\n"
